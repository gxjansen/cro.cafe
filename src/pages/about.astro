      <h1>About CRO.CAFE</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        The CRO.CAFE Podcast is an interview-driven show that gives you honest conversations on CRO,
        experimentation, user research and digital marketing from the people that live it. Through
        humor, grace and grit, Guido and his guests give you the tools, insights and motivation you

      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>
        To create a world where having a great user experience is the norm and where we have an
        open, healthy and powerful CRO ecosystem.
      </p>

      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Employees need to make (more) business decisions based on actual customers behavioral data.
        This is done by moving away from gut-feeling decisions, using qualitative and quantitative
        research and embracing experimentation and validation practices throughout organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CRO.CAFE advances and empowers the global CRO community and ecosystem through an open
        exchange of ideas, education, and thought leadership. We bring you the world's stories on
        innovation & experimentation and make it universally accessible and useful.
      </p>

# Next tasks:

## Fix guest detail page episode links ✅ COMPLETED

Fixed issue where episode links on guest detail pages (like `/guest/abi-hough`) were leading to `/en/episodes/undefined` instead of the actual episode pages. The problem was in `src/pages/guest/[slug].astro` line 139 where it was trying to access `episode.slug` instead of `episode.data.attributes.slug`.

**Status**: Episode links now correctly navigate to proper episode pages (e.g., `/en/episodes/abi`).

## Host Pages Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

[x] Create host utilities (`src/utils/hosts.ts`)
[x] Create host layout (`src/layouts/HostLayout.astro`)
[x] Create host detail pages (`src/pages/host/[slug].astro`)
[x] Create hosts overview page (`src/pages/hosts/index.astro`)
[x] Implement episode association logic (finds episodes by author field)
[x] Show hosted shows with episode counts (no individual episode widgets as requested)
[x] Add proper SEO meta tags and structured data
[x] Ensure accessibility compliance
[x] Test navigation flow and functionality
[x] Link all HostCard components to host detail pages (episode pages, home pages, host sections)

**Status**: Fully operational host pages at `/hosts` and `/host/[slug]` with profile information, bio, and shows hosted. Successfully tested with Guido's profile showing 48 Dutch episodes hosted. All HostCard components across the site now link to host detail pages.

## Show total # episodes and # guests on homepage

## Popular Episodes ✅ COMPLETED

[x] Get Episode statistics from Transistor
[x] Figure out how/where to store this information
[x] Add component to show popular episodes (on language landing pages)

**Status**: Fully operational with 1,814 episodes processed and analytics-driven popular episodes display working across all language pages.

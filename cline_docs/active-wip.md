# Next tasks:

## Fix guest detail page episode links âœ… COMPLETED

Fixed issue where episode links on guest detail pages (like `/guest/abi-hough`) were leading to `/en/episodes/undefined` instead of the actual episode pages. The problem was in `src/pages/guest/[slug].astro` line 139 where it was trying to access `episode.slug` instead of `episode.data.attributes.slug`.

**Status**: Episode links now correctly navigate to proper episode pages (e.g., `/en/episodes/abi`).

## Host Pages Implementation âœ… COMPLETED

[x] Create host utilities (`src/utils/hosts.ts`)
[x] Create host layout (`src/layouts/HostLayout.astro`)
[x] Create host detail pages (`src/pages/host/[slug].astro`)
[x] Create hosts overview page (`src/pages/hosts/index.astro`)
[x] Implement episode association logic (finds episodes by author field)
[x] Show hosted shows with episode counts (no individual episode widgets as requested)
[x] Add proper SEO meta tags and structured data
[x] Ensure accessibility compliance
[x] Test navigation flow and functionality
[x] Link all HostCard components to host detail pages (episode pages, home pages, host sections)

**Status**: Fully operational host pages at `/hosts` and `/host/[slug]` with profile information, bio, and shows hosted. Successfully tested with Guido's profile showing 48 Dutch episodes hosted. All HostCard components across the site now link to host detail pages.

## Fix host pages missing header and footer âœ… COMPLETED

Fixed issue where host pages like `/host/guido` were missing the default header and footer components that are present on guest pages like `/guest/julia-rumpf`.

**Root Cause**: The [`HostLayout.astro`](src/layouts/HostLayout.astro:40) was using the basic [`Layout.astro`](src/layouts/Layout.astro:1) component directly, while [`GuestLayout.astro`](src/layouts/GuestLayout.astro:39) correctly uses [`PageLayout.astro`](src/layouts/PageLayout.astro:40) which includes the [`Header`](src/components/widgets/Header.astro:1) and [`Footer`](src/components/widgets/Footer.astro:1) components.

**Solution**: Updated [`HostLayout.astro`](src/layouts/HostLayout.astro:40) to use [`PageLayout`](src/layouts/PageLayout.astro:40) instead of the basic [`Layout`](src/layouts/Layout.astro:1) component.

**Verification**: Tested both `/host/guido` and `/host/michael` pages - both now correctly display:
- âœ… Header with CRO.CAFE logo, search bar, language selector, and theme toggle
- âœ… Footer with navigation links, platform links, and copyright notice
- âœ… All existing functionality preserved (profile info, bio, shows hosted)

## Show total # episodes and # guests on homepage

## Popular Episodes âœ… COMPLETED

[x] Get Episode statistics from Transistor
[x] Figure out how/where to store this information
[x] Add component to show popular episodes (on language landing pages)
[x] add a sorting option to sort by popularity (on episode overview page)

**Status**: Fully operational with 1,814 episodes processed and analytics-driven popular episodes display working across all language pages.

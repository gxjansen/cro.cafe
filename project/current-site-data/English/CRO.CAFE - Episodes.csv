In this episode, he interviews Andre and Julia, the masterminds behind the Growth Marketing Summit, discussing the event's evolution from a small 2010 gathering to a prominent summit for optimization professionals. They explore the transition from Conversion Summit to Growth Marketing Summit and the future rebranding to Growth Minded Superheroes. The conversation highlights the importance of community, networking, and personal interactions in the ever-evolving landscape of growth marketing.</p><p id="""">Get your tickets here: <a href=""https://www.growthmarketingsummit.com/"" id="""">https://www.growthmarketingsummit.com/</a></p><p>‍</p>",,,,"<p id="""">[00:00:00] Welcome to a new episode of CRO.Café. I'm Guido Janssen, and guess what? After a long hiatus, I am back with some new episodes that you don't want to miss. It's been a while, but just like a superhero returning from a secret mission, I'm ready to dive back in the world of CRO. next week I am visiting the growth marketing summit in Frankfurt, where a hand selected lineup of optimizers will take the stage and inspire you with their raw knowledge. And I am the lucky bastard that was asked by the organization to interview all these experts from the stage and the audience in our own CRO Cafe.</p><p id="""">Podcast booth on the exhibitors floor. So naturally on today's episode, I have Andre and Julia, the masterminds behind this event to talk about growth, the mind and superheroes. So welcome back and let's get started with my first question to Julia. About how this event actually got started. Yeah, actually, you know, I [00:01:00] just thought about that because I came in here now and, took over the event from Andre this year take care of everything.</p><p id="""">And then I looked back and thought, Oh, he initiated this in 2010. And then I asked, I remember Andrea asked you, why did you do that? And what was like the, the main idea of doing an event like this? And you said. You know, initially we just wanted to bring together optimizers to connect, to network with. We had some clients, that just wanted to exchange ideas and talk about challenges they are facing.</p><p id="""">So in 2010, Andre came up with the Conversion And, Andre, if I'm right, there was like a two day event, right, with a boot camp, workshop, and bringing together already 200 people at that time. Yeah. We wanted to do a combination of conference and bar camp. Back then, bar camps were very famous, and that's maybe an unhappy anecdote.</p><p id="""">We called it conversion camp for the very first edition, and we did not know that the Catholic Church in the U. S. was doing something [00:02:00] there called conversion camp. which was to, convert, gay people into straight people, which is horrible, horrible idea. We did not know that something stupid like this even exists, but that was feedback from people in the U S.</p><p id="""">I heard similar feedback when, when Tom organized the conversion hotel in the Netherlands. also the Americans were thinking, what is this going on? so We quickly renamed it to Conversion because our idea of a summit is like we wanted to have the best people together.</p><p id="""">Back then I was already traveling around the world giving speeches at conferences and I saw there's a huge gap between the brightest people doing the best talks and the lesser good. Good talk. So my strategy was I create like a handpicked lineup of the best people I meet during the year.</p><p id="""">So my value proposition back then was you don't need to travel two, five or six different conferences. I already handpicked the best people for you.</p><p id="""">Yeah, we were talking about this at the beginning. CRO is [00:03:00] dead, isn't it? Some people say. Conversion. We, quickly realize that conversion rate is a stupid metric to focus your experiments on. or maybe not the best in all cases. We thought conversion rate optimization is too narrow. Or you could even go back to landing page optimization. there was a time back in 2008, I think Tim Ash published his book called Landing Page Optimization. That was a huge thing back then. So meaning you only optimize the landing pages and the rest.</p><p id="""">there was this time of landing page optimization, A B testing, then it, kind of submerged into conversion rate optimization. That was a time we call it conversion, summit, but we quickly realize it's about experimentation and, customer experience optimization and these topics.</p><p id="""">And they are basically there for growth. So we thought about. Calling it growth summit, but then, we found the name growth marketing summit interesting. So that's how we ended up with that name. We always wanted to find a name that clarifies what we [00:04:00] stand for. the audience profile changed a bit, you know, because we noticed more people from areas like product management are interested in this.</p><p id="""">in this topic as well and joined the summit. So we see more product owners, product managers coming to our event, UX designers. So it was quite a broad audience. whereas in the beginning, I think, Andre, it was really like the pure CRO people, and then like we broadened it up. And so we had to change the name to also make sure people understand it's really about something more holistically.</p><p id="""">called growth. And then the question of course becomes is growth marketing summit still a good name? that's, that implies what this podcast already called growth minded superheroes. And the answer is no. growth marketing implies this is for all the people that work for marketing inside marketing together with marketing, but the world is changing [00:05:00] and maybe this represents the maturity I just talked about.</p><p id="""">Landing page optimization, conversion rate optimization, then we call it experimentation and more and more teams are getting involved. So, now we realize, growth is a discipline for. all teams. </p><p id="""">It's still also for marketing people, for product people, for everyone. Actually, what Julia came up with, an idea I really like and I really support is, renaming it to growth minded superheroes, because everybody who comes to this conference, is a superhero because these are people that care, that want to learn more, that want to grow.</p><p id="""">I want to raise immaturity. These are the fighters for truth inside each company. We want to support them. We want to make them, the superheroes of our conference. So we will call it growth minded superheroes in future. It's also exemplifies what we stand for as a community with. A growing evolving and yeah, sometimes the names need to change because, audience changes, reality changes.</p><p id="""">So Julia, I'm now, [00:06:00] of course, very curious, does it only, imply a name change or what else is going to change this year? I don't want to, tell too much. So not too many spoilers, but just some hints would be nice. no, I mean, in the end, just to add to Andre's point, what was important also by changing the name is for us.</p><p id="""">Because it's all about the community. It's about the people, we noticed over the years that what makes the event so special is of course, the hand selected lineup of speakers that Andrea is always selecting, to have the best and, most relevant topics on stage, but then it's all about the attendees because we have such a strong community of people, a lot of people coming back, each year, we are growing the community. And the networking aspect of the conference is so important. And that's why we thought we need to put in the middle of everything, the people. So that's why we want to call it superheroes, because it's about the people, about the superheroes that make the event so special.</p><p id="""">And then about your question, what will be changed? Yeah, of course, [00:07:00] there will be a few surprises. but yeah, I don't want to spoil it too much. So people should experience it themselves. We always try to improve. We always try to optimize the conference. And what Andre and I did, was talking to a lot of attendees from last year to get some feedback, to optimize the event itself and to put this feedback into the event.</p><p id="""">And I really hope that this worked out. So the biggest complaint last year with this fresh fruit, fruit, fruit, sorry, fresh fruit was missing for the breakfast. Okay. If this is the biggest problem. Sounds like a great event, but that's the biggest complaint. Exactly, that's the biggest complaint. What changed is that we increased the possibilities to network with others.</p><p id="""">And it sounds maybe, unconvenient for introverted people, but we make it as convenient as possible because I think, you have the possibility to talk to a couple of hundred people there who did maybe on average a couple of dozen or a hundred experiments. [00:08:00] So you can learn so much by talking to other attendees.</p><p id="""">And we try to make that as easy and convenient for everyone, even the introverts who say, well, I don't want to talk to other people. No problem. Come to growth marketing summit and experience it. Are there any, particular topics or speakers that you're looking forward to this year or that you personally think, Hey, this is going to be a really important topic.</p><p id="""">looking out for next five years in zero or growth. what's going to be really important for people, to listen to or to think about. It's a tough question because, As I said, all the speeches are kind of handpicked and I'm looking forward to each of them. It's always surprising that finally it turns out different.</p><p id="""">compared to what you had in mind. but what I am looking forward to is a speech that we never had, before. and it's a talk from my colleagues, from two colleagues of conversions cuff, both coming from a product organization, and [00:09:00] talking about the pain they experienced inside product organizations and how to solve it.</p><p id="""">And that was their motivation to switch into CRO or experimentation and optimization and now they see the benefits that the two worlds could have from each other. And it's a speech that is all about closing the gap, bridging the worlds together. So I'm really looking forward to this one, although it's from our own.</p><p id="""">it's a tough one for our people. You know, they know that there are many well experienced speakers. So there's a high, no pressure and mark. Yeah, no pressure. Could you please talk about this and that? So, no, I, have a lot of respect for, our colleagues that also take the stage. And, Julia, talking about, going out there, especially after COVID, everyone's used to working remotely now, and there's a lot of, online conferences, webinars that we can, follow.</p><p id="""">So why do we still need to go to an offline conference? Why do we still need to travel? Why is this so [00:10:00] important? Yeah. You know, we were a bit scared after COVID, if people would really come back to the event because everyone was afraid. And then we noticed people loved that, they really needed, the exchange with others, the networking and the personal exchange and not only talking online.</p><p id="""">and that's why we see the growing numbers also of attendees, joining. And we're convinced that it's so valuable to be there to have the time also at the get together in the evening, you know, that gives space that you would never have in an online meeting to discuss things very personally. and that's why I'm totally convinced that events will be very important also in the future.</p><p id="""">People are social, people are social. Period. Right? Social interactions. Even for introverted people. They need social interactions and, This is why we think growth marketing summit is an experience, including the networking breaks and the coffee breaks. we will have some activities where people can participate and everything.</p><p id="""">[00:11:00] We have the, networking reception after the conference. speaking with other people is so valuable. Some people say, this is even more valuable than the speeches. They were inspiring, but connecting to like minded people who are in a different or similar situation, learning from them coming from different companies, but being in a similar situation, that's so valuable.</p><p id="""">So you can't do that online. It won't work. As someone that's leaning towards the introverted side. I started the podcast. To still talk to people, but, still going to, offline events. I think after COVID, it even gives some extra energy because people are at home all the time.</p><p id="""">Now it's extra special to go to, there's more intent behind it. There's more, energy, to go into such an event to make it even more special. and then you can go rest at home again. That's fine. That's also good. That's nice. But the meaning of everyone that you're already talking to, to a screen all day, it's very nice to do that in real life.</p><p id="""">And as Andre already said, we [00:12:00] wanted to make it as easy as possible also for the introverted to connect with each other. You know, I mean, you don't have to talk to each other, of course, but so you're not forced, but we will make it as easy as possible, for example, by providing for the first time an event app.</p><p id="""">This year that also connect easier with people to set tags for topics that you are interested in that you want to learn more about and to find the right people to match, you know, so I think that's also something that will really make a difference this year. as a visitor, how can I get the most out of the events?</p><p id="""">Should I bring certain things? do I need to prepare something? What do I need to do? How can I make this the best event of the year for me? </p><p id="""">how should you prepare? That's a good question. Just be there. So be, be open-minded, you know, I. Exactly. That would have been my answer. Just be open minded, go there with like a positive attitude and just think, okay, [00:13:00] you can learn.</p><p id="""">You will definitely take something from here. If it's from the talk, if it's from the networking, just be open, talk to people and use the opportunity that it gives. the only thing that I would say is now that I talked about the app, download the app like a few days before, set up your profile, set up the tags and things you're interested in to connect easier, you won't miss a talk as we only have the single stream.</p><p id="""">That's also different from other conferences where you have to pick topics in and then you have this, FOMO and think, Oh my God, I need to attend this or no, I want to attend this. But you have the single stream, single track conference where you can't miss a thing. that's also important for me.</p><p id="""">Other than that, yeah, just enjoy. Be present. Yeah. it's not that often that I'm speechless, but this time you caught me. I have no idea how you could prepare for, attending the conference, but I have one answer to that question as well. You know, because what I observed is people sitting in their [00:14:00] companies talking to their colleagues </p><p id="""">I would call it being trapped in their bubble. Everybody is trapped in their job bubble. And Many times you think, well, am I the only one that needs to convince their bosses to do X, Y, Z, whatever? am I the only one that has a lack of resources here? Am I the only one that thinks I'm fighting against whatever?</p><p id="""">And I think this is, something you will learn, when you come to, GMS, right? That there are people that have the same bubble. In different companies. And that's what I mean when I say the only thing you need is be a little bit open minded because you can learn from these people, they might have solved some things that you still need to solve.</p><p id="""">And also regarding the different names and the history we have, what we went through, [00:15:00] you will see people that already are in a different stage. Well, we now have product teams and we want to make them experimentation ready. while you are still in a center of excellence and you try to have a centralized approach and you're still remember how it was when you were the only team that did AB tests and whatever.</p><p id="""">So you will be helpful for everyone else that, that has a different maturity. You can learn from each other. because you maybe solved some of the hurdles already to move forward. And so that's the only thing you need. Be open minded, listen to the stories of other people. Exactly. I mean, at minimum you can just give each other a hug or cry together because you have the same problems, but more likely you will be able to solve your problems by talking to people and sharing challenges that you have.</p><p id="""">That's the value proposition, the whole community of growth marketing summit attendees is maybe, the [00:16:00] biggest walking asset, the biggest database of knowledge and experience that you can find, in the world. You won't find another place where you have that many people. For the real networking that happens in between.</p><p id="""">And that's the way you talk to your peers about, Hey, I have the same issue or I solve this in this way. Of course, at the networking and, the get together after the events on maybe during breakfast. We have some nice fruits. that's something we really improved and I think that will raise our NPS, to astronomical heights.</p><p id="""">We already ordered so many bananas and you can't imagine, I have so many bananas. Number one tip in organizing a conference in 2024, bring, bring fruit and lots of it. So, yeah, for everyone, June 19th in Frankfurt, book your tickets. If you don't have them yet, to, growth marketing summit.</p><p id="""">com and we'll all be joining some fresh fruits together then. Thanks. that's what will [00:17:00] do. Thank you. Julia. Thanks, Thanks. See June. Bye bye.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p>‍</p>",false,

My name is Simbar Dube and you're listening to the CRO.CAFE podcast. The show where we give you raw conversations based on real experimentation experience and consistent conversion optimization results. In today's episode, I'm joined by one of the top experts in conversion optimization, Rich Page, which is one of the few people who have been doing conversion rate optimization for more than 15.</p><p>Before writing two books about conversion optimization. He wrote a thesis on usability for his masters. </p><p>[00:00:34] <strong>Rich:</strong> Yeah. So I've always been really interested in improving websites. I used to try to email that some of the owners of websites when I found things, I didn't like. When I was much younger back when Amazon was back in the mid nineties so I've always really been interested in improving websites.</p><p> Then I actually wrote a thesis on usability website, usability for my masters. Which cause it was a fan used blood usability really interesting and has an impact on the usability of websites. And then actually I started to get really interesting into learning what actually happens at websites and how they perform and by using web analytics.</p><p>So I'm one of the books that really got me into that was web analytics scenario. Which was an amazing, real eye-opener book, which was really interesting. Cause I didn't, I'd never would have dreamt that I would eventually write a book in the same series. There's our a D series. But then and then when the other really eyeopening things that I read was a book called call to action by Brian Eisenberg, which that was one of his first books. I think that was need to yeah, 2005. And it was, and that really opened up my eyes to what you can do with CRO and AB testing to improve websites.</p><p> And then the rest is really history. I've got other things that really helped get me into this industry are online marketing. I did a lot of online marketing and started to realize why don't things always work that well. So then you start to realize, oh, is it because of the website?</p><p>So that's not really helps. And I'm related really well to CRO. </p><p>[00:02:21] <strong>Simbar:</strong> Okay. So was it called conversion rate optimization or there was a different name? </p><p>[00:02:27] <strong>Rich:</strong> That's a very good question. It was more about AB testing back in those days. Yeah. And CRO term got big ironically my book or I called website optimization because it wasn't that term was more popular than the CRO in the day.</p><p>So my publisher decided they would be better to call it website optimization. And the problem is that then confuse people that thought that was. So it changed summarization. And then that CRO term has finally become a bit more widespread in the industry now. Which is conduced </p><p>[00:03:05] <strong>Simbar:</strong> before you got into conversion, optimizing.</p><p>What were you doing to pay the bills? What was helping you pay the bills? I was doing online marketing for a couple of businesses and which was really interesting doing things like Google ads, SEO and other types of online marketing. And then I started to want to know exactly the performance a bit.</p><p>[00:03:32] <strong>Rich:</strong> So that's how I got into being a web analyst. And then. Started that role. And then I then realized, oh I want to know I'm not, I don't want to just do reporting. I want to actually give insights into, okay. This is what I recommend based on what I've seen. You need to improve X, Y. To fix those issues where you know, that people are dropping off at a certain page, or they're not getting to where they're supposed to do or they're abandoning the checkout.</p><p>So that's what really, that's the path that really took me into CRO. And I think it's a good kind of, I think it's hard to really. Get straight into CRO without having some kind of background in those some people talk about statistics a lot, for example it's useful, but I think being a web analyst is actually even more important and having that mindset of trying to analyze what could be wrong to come up with the ideas, to improve in the.</p><p>[00:04:36] <strong>Simbar:</strong> You have been doing this for more than 15 years? I think you're one of the odd years in conversion rate optimized. How many new websites do you think you've optimized so far? </p><p>[00:04:46] <strong>Rich:</strong> Yeah, it's a good question. I've been doing many website audits. I've been, I don't know, hundreds in the last 15 years, all the way from when I used to work for Disney was one of them.</p><p>I was their manager of reporting and analysis. When I started to get into AB testing and CRO for them to bigger clients like Vodafone, when I was working at Adobe. And then all the way to through smaller e-commerce companies, smaller software as a service businesses. Yeah I've worked for hundreds of different types of businesses as well.</p><p> Hundreds of probably getting on 500 different types of websites. They don't mean to just, this is my real passion. </p><p>[00:05:42] <strong>Simbar:</strong> There are different kinds of conversion research techniques, but you specialize on customer and visitor severe. I was always using web analytics and to come up with insights for better website improvement ideas.</p><p>[00:05:58] <strong>Rich:</strong> But I really discovered that if you get into this conversion research and do things like visits to serve. And customer surveys really well, the forms of goldmine of insights and website improvement, ideas that work much better than just relying on best practices, which don't often work for websites because every website's unique, every website's different.</p><p>Companies out there focused on that. Too many people just chase those quick wins and the they're disappointed when they didn't work. What's because if they're not listening to your audience and understanding what their needs and doubts and hesitations are and what they're really having issues with and want to have improved, then you're chasing.</p><p>Yeah, you're barking up the wrong tree almost, and you're not going to have as big impact from what you're doing there. Yeah that's how I've got into really doing this and specializing in and then it's and it's fascinating. It really is. </p><p>[00:07:06] <strong>Simbar:</strong> Yeah. It's a fascinating thing for sure.</p><p>And I think people tend to misunderstand a lot of things about conversion rate optimization are a lot of aspects, but when it comes to. Customer envious to surveys. Do you think that's also the case? </p><p>[00:07:23] <strong>Rich:</strong> Yeah, I think whenever I initially see, I want to do these surveys to my clients or I talk about them along them.</p><p>A lot of people think of these surveys as being like product surveys that are just asking about what did you think of the product or what did you think of. Your customer service which are a pretty dry topic. And obviously the people who are completing them don't really care about them.</p><p>They usually 50 questions long. They take you way too long to answer. So there's, there is some kind of negative connotations with those, whereas the types of vision customer services that work well for in CRO are more to do with improving the visitor experience. So trying to get feedback on what they were doing online, what they liked, what they didn't like.</p><p> So those are really important things that the differentiation and misunderstanding about those servers. And also a lot of people think that these visitor surveys, because so many people are starting to do them, but they're not doing them very well. And unfortunately they make the mistake of popping them up immediately, which is crazy if you think about it, because if you've just arrived on our website, you're not going to have, not only are you going to be annoyed by seeing.</p><p> You, you won't even have any of had any time to use the website to give any good feedback. So that's why I think the surveys get a bad rep. </p><p>[00:08:50] <strong>Simbar:</strong> Yes. I'm one of those people who thinks that pop-ups in surveys can be annoying and distracting sometimes. So how do you come up with a survey that is more appealing and less annoying is the best way you can take it balance between.</p><p>Less annoying and more appealing. </p><p>[00:09:09] <strong>Rich:</strong> So yeah, this is the surveys. What you really need to do is you need to, first of all, get around that point of when to ask them using pop-up survey. So what you would do is you. Make that appear generally after a couple of minutes. And ideally you want to make it show only after they have seen a product page or a service page or a pricing page or something that would indicate that they are, they've got quite far down their journey.</p><p> Don't leave it up to the checkout point. Obviously you won't get somebody. And there any way to give you that information. So that's going to be really important. And then one of the other key things is the not only the questions you use. Cover later on, but how are you even asking for this feedback?</p><p>Because I, this is probably another thing that you probably are annoyed with is that when people may have run these business services previously, they may have a not incentivized it because, and therefore not got many varying responses. So give. On it like, oh, that didn't work. I tried, it didn't work.</p><p>Or they they will offer we will give a five, whatever it is, five pound, $5 incentive. If you complete this survey or they will say when a hundred pound or when a hundred dollars or whatever you have a chance to win it now. Neither of those work particularly well, because often people will just fill those surveys in to try to win the incentive.</p><p> I've seen in the results. It's oh I really want to win the survey or mean that I can finally buy this this prize. I thought of the idea a couple of years ago to change that, to be instead of saying we, you can win you have a chance of winning actually changing that to be.</p><p>To see if you give us the best and most useful feedback to us, you could win. And this prize, which actually makes them work harder and give better feedback. And it makes it really cuts down this kind of crap of visitors just responding yes or no kind of answers. And really I've got some amazing detailed answers.</p><p> So that to me is one of the biggest improvements that anyone can make to their surveys is how actually, how they're popping up that question to get people interested and setting up that right to expectation of what they need to do in order to try to win it. So that works extremely well.</p><p> And then some other things for actually setting up the visitor survey. I talked about when it should show and then the incentivizing it, but you you also what else was there? I would also offer a kind of a gift certificate either to your own website or if you are, if you want to make it even more broad, you could offer like an Amazon gift certificate, $50 works well, depending on the budget I've gone to have had clients who've gone up to $250.</p><p> One time for the best. Which is what the best. And if you think about it, you're probably spending hundreds per week per even per day on Google ads or something. So this is a drop in the ocean of, in comparison to the insights you'll get from it. So try to get as much as give it the, as the higher you get the more responses that you will get.</p><p> And then, because you really need it really nice to at least need a hundred responses from this visitor survey to be able to get enough insights to, to to get enough feedback to work with. So that's what I really recommend. And then customer surveys, or just talk about setting those up quickly.</p><p>The key difference with that is that you need to email this survey to your customers, and it should be slightly different than than the visitor feedback visit. The feedback really should be like five racial questions. Again, I'll cover those in a minute of what they should be. But they're more to do of that.</p><p>Getting that quick first impression. And asking them some of the things that might be causing them problems or not understanding, whereas, so yeah, customer, so customer surveys are different than visitor surveys because they really tried to get that feedback from the people who have purchased. And it's really important to do that because you'll help understand what nearly stopped them from purchase.</p><p>That is one of the key things that you need to ask the customers, because if you can figure that out then and address those issues on your website maybe they didn't trust you or they couldn't quite do something or you didn't have enough information, then you can fix your website, address those issues and to stop other people.</p><p> Potentially not purchasing just like this person, just like our customer, nearly didn't purchase. So it's really important there. And then as we were saying, yeah, this will be longer than your visitor survey. So this is a survey you want to limit to five or six questions just as to be short to the point where this can be a bit longer 15, 20 questions don't go like 50 questions or something.</p><p>Ridiculous for us. On some of these surveys out there that you're just get such a high drop off rate towards the end and people just get annoyed and give up. So that's the real differences between the customer service, but they're both really equally important. So business surveys will you'll get the people who haven't purchased yet, who will have.</p><p>And put some feedback, whereas customers they've already bought. They've been through the whole journey and purchased, so they will actually have just as good feedbacks. They can tell you as I said, what nearly stopped them from purchasing. </p><p>[00:15:36] <strong>Simbar:</strong> Okay. So when it comes to customer surveys and customer interviews, I believe that the quality of feedback and insights you get.</p><p>From your customers is determined by the quality of questions that you ask them. So meaning that if you ask them garbage questions, you're going to get garbage insights or garbage feedback. So do you have a specific questions that you normally ask your customers questions that guarantee quality?</p><p>[00:16:05] <strong>Rich:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, sure. Because I've been doing these, so now I've worked out what questions of what seem to get better results and better insights than others. One of my favorites at the moment for visitor surveys is what doubts or hesitations do you have about this? And that's good because it will really help understand if there's any trust or credibility issues.</p><p> Like that maybe they don't know who you are well enough for you. Don't you're not showing social proof or other things, those all you'll get some good answers there which will help them. By the way, when you're in the beginning of the survey, you should always ask people to be to be honest as possible and to give any suggestions for improvements because you don't want people to just be nice.</p><p>That's the worst thing, even with user tests, as well as like you just getting people who. Just polite and oh yes, this is great. Oh, I would have purchased. Cause you don't care about that. You almost want them to see bad things. I prefer it when they do. So that's really important too.</p><p> I mentioned in in the introduction to the survey, when you're asking these questions, So that's one, that's a really good question for visitor surveys. Another one that works really I've learned is there anything stopping you from purchasing, writing? Similar to the pressure and just mentioned, but this is really like perhaps they have just tried to find something that they couldn't find and don't know the answer to it.</p><p>Therefore perhaps they're trying to, they can't find out how much it is for shipping or they can't. They don't understand about the return services or they don't understand how the free troll works. Whether they're going to get billed us some point, all those types of things or perhaps they even find they found an issue on your website, like maybe there was something broken.</p><p>So that's why that's a really good question then. For another really good question to ask is, and this is trying to help understand your customer ideal customer in, in. And a bit broader terms asking what are the key factors that influence their purchase decision when they're buying something like that?</p><p>Because once you know that it may be very different than what you think it is. So if you think that it's the quality and actually. And they care more about price. Then maybe you want to adapt your messaging to mention that a bit more clearly, or perhaps they want the like with clothes, they want something that lasts a long time, rather than something that doesn't last very long that can give you some really good insights there, but all these are much better than just simply asking.</p><p> What do you think of this website, which are very broad, very do you have any issues with it? You need to almost frame them in this different way to try to get them to give that answer to you. That will give you the best feedback. </p><p>[00:19:27] <strong>Simbar:</strong> I liked that the examples you gave open-ended questions and they give customers enough room to express themselves.</p><p>But when you ask a customer or visitor, what doubts do you have on this website? I think that's more of a leading question that assumes that they were doting something on your way. Yeah. It is a good question, but the way I think about it, like it, it would be very rare for someone to come on your web.</p><p>[00:19:53] <strong>Rich:</strong> And purchase immediately without having any reservations. Everyone was always going to have some kind of doubt or hesitation. So don't think about being negative in that sense. And if they've already got down to that path of giving you feedback, they're probably quite interested in the product.</p><p>If people don't like your product on learn like your website, they're going to be gone immediately. So you would already factored out those kind of. </p><p>[00:20:24] <strong>Simbar:</strong> Okay. Suppose one of our listeners has an e-commerce website. How often should they launch a survey? And is there like a specific moment that they should learn?</p><p>[00:20:36] <strong>Rich:</strong> Yeah. So that's a very good question. So this is the survey you, I suggest doing this probably. First of all, if you haven't done it before, do it now go and do these questions. I offer services that help you come up with these specific questions, because it will allow those questions I've given, just talks about are very good general questions.</p><p>There are very specific ones. You're going to want to ask for your particular type of website that you see it's important that you get that right. First time. But then, so you need to launch that. Get, as I said, a hundred responses, do some analysis, be amazed at the insights that you'll get use those as ideas for AB testing.</p><p> And if you've got enough traffic, that is and then. Or just website improvements. If you don't have that luxury of having enough traffic to do a lot of AB testing, and then once you've done that, I would always recommend doing a follow-up perhaps in six months time, depending on how much you've get to improve.</p><p>So if you've if you've improved a significant amount in three months time, or I've already launched a major redesign, do it again. Because it's always important to get that feedback anytime you launch anything major. So as I said, first time, do it. If you've never done it before, then maybe once every six months a year.</p><p>And then also anytime you launching a new website or anything, major launches, and then with customers what I would do is I would do email it to them. And again, do it as soon as possible go back at least a year's worth of customers. If you go back much further, you or your website is probably could have already changed quite a lot.</p><p>So they may, and they may not remember using your website. So if you go back more than a year, you won't be as useful. But ideally you want to send that out to get that customer list and email it to. Give him a good friendly email, a good subject line to increase the chances of them reading it and opening it.</p><p>And then again, the incentive, same principle there, you may want to, I always just giving a higher incentive to these customers, customer service and the visitor. And then what you would do is you would do this automated after you've done that initial batch to catch the way over the last six months worth, you then would need to automate it.</p><p>So every time every after they've purchased, depending on if they have to wait to receive it, that you would send that survey whatever a week later via an email marketing automation. Which is obviously critical to try also to help and get them to come back there. It's so what's well for adding into an email automation so that every time someone purchases you get this, and then you just check.</p><p>Well, a list of survey responses from your customers whatever, every couple of weeks to see if there's anything really interesting in there. And so that's the best way of doing it. It's an ongoing process. The customer, certainly the customer serving.</p><p>[00:23:54] <strong>Simbar:</strong> Okay. Let's say that you have launched this at via, right? To what extent should you trust the responses? Sometimes they believe that what people say is not what they really do. Is there a way that you can try and improve the quality of response? </p><p>[00:24:11] <strong>Rich:</strong> Yeah, that's a very good question. And that was alluding to earlier.</p><p> So first of all, you need to change the, instead of just saying you have a chance to win it, it should be the person who gives the best feedback or most useful feedback. And you can tell, and while you're reading it, the people have. I have just rushed. Cause they the people who do spend time and really thoughtful, you'll start to see patterns in the feedback that you're getting.</p><p>And you're like, oh yeah, that kind of that person said that in a similar way over there oh, yeah. If we combine those two thoughts together, we could do this. So you're doing that will naturally. Yeah, weed out that people who are just eager to please and trying to win that contest.</p><p>And then as I was saying, when you're introducing the survey, you need to be saying things like, please be honest with your feedback, give suggestions and tell them, look, we're not just looking for praise and nice things. This is, we want you to be as honest as possible. We're looking for.</p><p>Constructive feedback. What we can improve if you don't mention that. Yeah. That's also gonna make people think they want it. They shouldn't be a lot of people are too nice. When they're in particularly the English, when they're. Feedback I've seen it's very oh yes, sorry to mention it they're very nice us a bit more direct for a fund, but in, in the so that's why it's always good in particular in the UK to ask this please be honest, don't worry about if anything is negative.</p><p> We're looking for the most useful and honest best feedback that will really help. </p><p>[00:26:10] <strong>Simbar:</strong> Okay. Okay. Let's just shift gears a bit here. We've chatted a lot about customer surveys. Do you have other techniques that you use to gather conversion research insights besides customer service? </p><p>[00:26:25] <strong>Rich:</strong> Yeah. Yeah that's a good, that's a good question.</p><p>Cause these customer surveys and just the surveys are are very important parts of commercial research. And in my opinion, you can't do effective commercial research commercial, which was actually went out here. There's also some other really high-impact ways of doing commercial research. The other one I always highly recommend is user testing.</p><p>So when you ask them. Similar questions you've got them on your website. You can actually ask them to do things, go to particular pages. You can guide them to parts that you. Particular feedback on. So that works really well setting up, but unit need to ensure that your target audience is it matches the user test is using democratic screen of questions.</p><p> To ensure that they are, that match your target audience. That is something get at least five years of tests on mobile fireball on desktop ask them similar types of questions. The other thing you can do is even at the end of it, you can ask them what other, please go to Google and try to find another website similar to this.</p><p> And they will go and they will give you an ask them for their feedback on another one. Just in the same way in the customer survey you another good question for that would have been did you consider nearly buying from someone else? And why did you nearly consider that? And if you get answers from that, then it will help you realize, okay, they've got that service or they've got this guarantee or they've got that messaging or content that seems to be missing.</p><p>That's really important. I was just you can do that with user testing. So you've got moderated user testing when it's. Where you can actually ask them specific questions. And if if they end up re interested in one particular page, as you can make the, you can dig deeper as you go.</p><p>But most common way of doing it is unmoderated. If you know where you, you set the questions in advance, and then they do it on their mobile phone, and then it gets sent to you with their audio and recording of the And answers, which gives again really good. And the other good thing with that is it will help you find bug fixes.</p><p>So business services sometimes they'll point out things that are broken, but quite often they won't have noticed them yet. Whereas on a full journey user test on your website or a mobile app desktop, they may uncover issues particularly interesting if they're using a like a mobile browser, maybe they're using like Samsung internet, for example, rather than using safari or Chrome, which may make you see oh, wow, look that's broken.</p><p>I shouldn't be like that. So also it's also really good for helping understand what could be broken because the other interesting is thing conversion rate optimization is you've got to fix the broken things like fix broken shit first. Cause if you don't do that, then even getting these ideas and insights from your customer customers via conversion research won't work as well.</p><p>If you've, if you're fundamentally got something not a good user experience that, that isn't. Detected very often. So that's why I use the testing. I would always highly recommend that and it will. Can we work well with, in, in combination with visitor and customer service? I highly recommend them.</p><p>And it's to me is really exciting and a really eyeopening, and I guarantee you that if you do it and you haven't done it before and you do it well, you will be like, wow, this is amazing, but better than any other kind of research I've ever done before, you will quite often see that. Particularly if you haven't done this.</p><p>[00:30:39] <strong>Simbar:</strong> Yeah, we have talked about how often this event should be launched the kind of questions that should be asked and how to improve the quality of customer. Let's talk about what you do with the feedback that you get from the customers. Suppose you get about 500 responses. What's next? </p><p>[00:30:56] <strong>Rich:</strong> Yeah. Very good question.</p><p> First of all with the business server, you can, I would actually stop it after 200 cause that will give you a good amount to analyze that you'll get a lot of patterns through that and a good cross section. Responses. So you don't really need much more than 200. You can always run it again after you've made it more improvements, but once you've got those what you need to do is you can use things like word clouds to pick out key words, but I don't really find them that useful.</p><p>Can I pull up words that are not really that or really that like shipping or delivery okay, it's one word on its own. Doesn't really give you much insight. But the best thing that you need to do is what's called like codifications. Of the types of insights you're getting. So whether it's an issue, whether it's a suggestion, whether it's a fix those are major categories there.</p><p>Then you would also do categorization by the page of that. It's. For the homepage, what are the major issues due to create a spreadsheet and write down those issues? Try to come up with the most interesting ones and list them down separately. And also the amount of times each is mentioned because that is also important to see if something gets.</p><p>50 times then that is going to be really important for you to address that in particular. So you use some kind of quantitative analysis in there as well, but don't just discard something. If it's only been mentioned once, because some people they may have not noticed it, or may not have even thought that it was an issue, but it actually isn't.</p><p>So that's why it's important to look at every response and spend S like good five, four or five hours to, to review the answers. Sit down with your team, review them with them and really then convert that into, excuse the pun into ideas for improving your website. And then you would then prioritize those depending on what page it's on.</p><p> How likely impact you think it's going to have on improving your work. And if you've got enough traffic, maybe test them. </p><p>[00:33:35] <strong>Simbar:</strong> Nice. Nice. This has been very insightful for our listeners. What do you think should be like the main takeaway from this episode when it comes to customer service, if they'd like maybe two or three takeaways that they should like grab from this </p><p>[00:33:56] <strong>Rich:</strong> episode.</p><p> I would say, first of all, get out of the mindset of the kind of dull, boring corporate product orientated surveys, and think about it in terms of visitor experience and customer experience. And then also the number one thing that will change everything is asking for the giving a higher incentive, like a hundred dollars or something for the best or most useful.</p><p> Cause you'll see all of that crap that you've when you may have done surveys before oh, this is just full of people saying yes or no, or like wanting to win the prize that will change the entire way of the results you get. But then ultimately if you don't ask good enough questions. That you won't get very good insights.</p><p>So we all it's not just a simple question of setting up a survey. It's like knowing what to ask, which is what I've come to learn after doing these so many times and how to ask it. Those are the key things with visitor surveys and the customer surveys, but don't give up if it doesn't. You can always increase the incentive try $50 to begin with.</p><p> You increase it to a hundred, again, it's peanuts and comparisons to value that will bring insights that will be will bring an, and it will work. Obviously if you've got very little traffic, it's going to be a problem. And there are other tools that you can use, like usability. You can actually try and find your target audience and usability hub and set up sub a mini survey.</p><p>Then the problem is they haven't been on your website. Really. You can show that you would have to show them their website in the usability hub and hope that the demographics are right, but then it's not anywhere near as good or reliable as getting visitors that are on your way. Yeah. But yeah, if you don't do anything else this week do this, because it will be very enlightening and we'll open your eyes to like how visitors, what they really think.</p><p>Great for proving to maybe your boss, doesn't like something done in a certain way or wants it done his way, or there's a fundamental way of in your business of doing something and you don't want to detract from it, but if you get this feedback enough of it all adds up, it will help you optimize your business as well as your web.</p><p>Okay. So that's all to me, conversion optimization is website related, but the bigger picture is business optimization where you know, making sure that your products, your customers love your product. The shipping is great that they come back again. Yeah, creating new products. It's all really important.</p><p>[00:36:55] <strong>Simbar:</strong> Okay. One of the things I usually ask people who are way ahead of me in terms of experience in conversion optimization is about books. What books are you reading now? But that's a good question. Books. I haven't read anything in a while. I find the problem with books is. By the time they've been written particularly with website techniques and stuff.</p><p>[00:37:23] <strong>Rich:</strong> I can speak from experience that I was lucky because it only took me about nine months to write my book and they published it pretty quickly. At the time they w they didn't have a lot of other publications going out at the same time, but then. Basically a year and a half for me to find some, I started writing it to the time it got launched.</p><p> And CRO the techniques grow like in, in the, in my, I didn't write that much about commercial research my robot best practices and AB testing things. But so like when I write a new book in the future, I would. Talk more about commercial research. But now my point here is that I find that with books that unless it's a board topic or a you know, like a marketing technique with a new spin on it or something that something radically different, I don't generally tend to read them.</p><p>I prefer reading articles from trusted sources. Like I'm one of the, one of the really good newsletters that I've liked at the moment is pebble yards, new agency called Spiro. He they've got this really good CRO insight news. I highly recommend that. Very good, very detailed, very different, highly recommend.</p><p> Looking at that one and where I get my, most of my value is being part of slack channels. There's so many great slack channels out there now where if you don't, if you want to get feedback from someone on their opinion of it, or if they've done it before that has really been tremendously helpful to even more than re them reading.</p><p>Book or even some of the courses out there. Again, PEPs CXL courses at the Institute is excellent. Highly recommend that. But yet books not so much, but if you are looking for the basics and you're very new to CRO, then. So you can read my book is quite old now, but it does cover the basics and the central is very well.</p><p> Yeah. And one of the other books that definitely recommend though, that gets talked about a lot is the influence by Robert CLD. Yeah. Yeah. Where it talks about the six major factors of persuasion things like social proof, urgency scarcity. That was a real eye-opener to me. And to start to use those techniques online because they've worked very well.</p><p>So if you haven't read that, I'm sure many of you have gone and read that it's a very good book. And it would get you thinking things in slightly different way. And then there's a draft web analytics books. Avinash Kaushik of managed Kaushik has done the web analytics 2.0, book old now for 10 years old, but still very relevant, still got amazing content in it.</p><p> He's got great news that he's got this great new it's like a VIP newsletter with, you have to pay for. She's got some real great nuggets in there that you can't easily get elsewhere. He's got free versions still, but definitely recommend that one as well. So yeah that's what I would say for him for recommendations to try to learn and CRO.</p><p>[00:40:58] <strong>Simbar:</strong> Okay. So for some of our listeners, when to connect with you, they want to recharge to you, where can they find you? </p><p>[00:41:06] <strong>Rich:</strong> You can reach out to me on LinkedIn I'm on there. Definitely. Or you can come to my website, rich-page.com. I'm not sure offering at the moment free 10 minute commercial reviews of any page of your choice or just somebody to do a quick recording.</p><p> And give you my initial thoughts about that. Is it often a good way of understanding what potential you have? So come check that out. As well, I'll include the link for.</p><p>[00:41:37] <strong>Simbar:</strong> Yeah, I'll make sure that I'll have the link in the transcript for these hips. </p><p>[00:41:42] <strong>Rich:</strong> And then I've also got a good blood post on medium that talks about all these different visitors, survey questions. There's and customer service questions. So definitely recommend checking that out. </p><p>[00:41:55] <strong>Simbar:</strong> That's all for this episode.</p><p>Thank you rich for taking attempt to share your knowledge with us and especially thanks to everyone listening.

So here we are.</p><p>My name is &nbsp;and welcome to Shiro cafe.

Thanks for joining us. you have a bachelor in data and system science, so I'm very curious. One of the things from that background that are still most useful to you today. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:01:36] hello, and thank you for, for having me. that's a good question. studying computer and system science, we.</p><p>First of all. I think they nailed the first course because it was a double, a amount of time course where we started everything from like ITP servers, to the hexadecimal system. being able to understand the binary code basically. So they get rid of it. A lot of people in the beginning of the course, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:09] basically it was a selection course, the right students for continuing the course, </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:02:13] something like that.</p><p>might be smart though, because it's always good to understand how things actually work like from the ground. What are the building blocks? Everything digital to work the way it does. And I think that kind of understanding, he's a little bit come greater at whatever you do within digital.</p><p>If you do have an understanding of how it works from the bottom up. Yeah. With that said we did a lot of programming as well. Of course, both front end and some backend. Which of course, has been a great advantage for me working within CRO because I've been able to build like all the AB tests myself basically.</p><p>and I'm noticed with so many other companies, organizations and people that when you can have so many great ideas, but the development part of it is like always the bottle, like. but it hasn't been that way for me. So I think thanks to that, I've been able to advance and just create this, high velocity, the testing, able to push a lot of experiments live because I've been able to code them myself.</p><p>And with that understanding, I always knew how long will it take for me to actually develop this experiment and get it live? So just from that, I had the greater understanding basically. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:38] Yeah. Yeah. at university, did you get, courses in, of course in programming, but were, is it the same programming language that you use today to, build the AB test?</p><p>And because that's a common, at least here in the Netherlands that I hear from a lot of people have we get programming at the university, but it's totally different than what we actually use in practice, to build websites or build diabetes. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:04:00] And I get that, With all organizations and companies, you choose your framework to work with.</p><p>And I had the fortune, at university to actually study basic HTML and CSS, but also playing on JavaScript and JavaScript is basically all you need to build tests. So that was great for me. and we also did some Python, which of course I don't use that much now, but being able to understand the, how to significant calculate, your tests and what our data scientists are doing too.</p><p>be able to build like a monitoring tool through Python has helped me a lot because we can have a good conversation around </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:40] it. Yeah. In the old debates bison versus are, I think I know where your preference lies. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:04:46] I don't have a preference that much because I'm not the one to build it, but if I can have the understanding of it, I think that helps the conversation a lot.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:54] Nice. So I was wondering, so how did you acquire the nickname queen or Shiro? </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:05:00] Yeah, that's a good question </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:03] because you already got that at your first job, right? </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:05:06] Yeah, it's crazy. I actually, I worked at a company called I prospect, and in that company we had a small team called, We named it, the duck team, it's spelled D a C not duck acid duck, but it's pronounced exactly the same.</p><p>It stands for, dashboards, analytics, CRO. We were very small team with four people or something. because at that time, like six years ago, not that many were working within these areas, and a coworker of mine. Out of nowhere, I guess I want to say, because I don't know how he came up with it, but he just started calling me the queen of CRO, because I guess they were so amazed with what I was doing or, I was the only one working with CRO at the office at the top.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:55] So then you automatically become the queen. Yeah. That makes sense. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:05:58] And he spread it around. So I guess it's thanks to him. And that's how I got the nickname, basically. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:05] Exactly. And, and today, we moved to a two in the meantime, and today we're talking about the six steps to get your experimentation culture running.</p><p>I think that's a topic that, are of interest to a lot of sheroes, especially when they work in a company by themselves. Or just a small team and have a lot of people to convince. but before we dive into those six steps to get a sense, of your role at right now. So what is your current team look like?</p><p>And, yeah. Can you share a bit of, what you're working on right now? </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:06:34] Yeah, of course. So today I have a split role at two, actually. so I work 50% as the, CRO and UX lead for two in Nordics. And 50% of my time, I work as a CRO manager for our global function within two week call to a group. so they serve of course, two different purposes and my Nordic role, I'm responsible for, the team that works with CRO and UX.</p><p>this team has been built up, through the past year, basically. We, or the organization made the decision, last fall. So about half a year ago that CRO and UX would actually be together, before that it was only CRO. but since they're so close related and within my MassArt at university, I also started in direction design.</p><p>So UX is very closely related to me and what I know from before. So for me, that made total sense, to merge those two together. And from that we build the team. So basically what we did have was, two CRO specialists, two UX, the signers, two UI designers, one analytics person, one dedicated CRO developer, who worked like cross function to the product teams, that we had.</p><p>I say that's how the team was and what that did look like because, because of the coral and a pandemic that we are in there have been changes. And I did post about this on my Instagram. or sorry, my LinkedIn some time ago, which has been really hard for all of us and especially, being in the travel industry.</p><p>There are some team changes right now, and we will need to build up again once we get out of this, but that's the structure that we have had and that we are going to have a, when we get out of this. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:33] Yeah, I can imagine, especially since you're in tourism, a lot of changes in customer behavior and, the revenue bonds have been, favorable frigging.</p><p>I can imagine. Yeah. so let's just get into those six steps, to get your experimentation culture running. I think it makes sense that maybe a quickly mentioned a, the six steps first before we dive into them. so it's be your hero. running masterclasses, results. number five is, what I've learned this week, or that was number four, number five, zero showcase, and number six, the monthly dashboard.</p><p>So let's start with, with, be the hero.</p><p>So what's the, so what's that one about, you need to be the CRO hero of your company, maybe the queen, even depending on what you want. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:09:21] Actually, this is a little, a little tweak to this one. It's a little foolish actually, because I do display forest, be the hero. but it's not actually what I mean.</p><p>what I'm trying to, get people to understand here is that you need to be very humble in this role, zero specialist in whatever organization or at you need to be humble about what you are doing and what you are changing on the site. And by that you need to involve a lot of people and always learning preaching as well.</p><p>But teaching. Your stakeholders and people close to you about what zero is like, why we're doing this, teaching them about the users and how it could work. and by doing that and getting people more involved, you are giving them the insight that they need in order to make the right decisions. That's basically what's, there is, when you're doing that, you feel. Maybe like the hero, but what you're actually doing is you're making the people who you work closest with to be the hero themselves, because they can reach out even further to the company and say, are web developers that this, and we know that this is the right way to go because we have this data on it.</p><p>And then they can show that what they are actually doing right now is the best possible choice. Yeah. So it's not about you being the hero. It's about making everyone else be the hero </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:52] you need to meet an invisible hero. The person that enables all of us in the company. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:10:57] Yeah. So you can give them the insights needed, then the recommendations and the data, and basically the knowledge to be able to.</p><p>Make them make the best decision. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:05] And you said in your presentation, not everyone will like you when you started with the CRO. So I'm very interested in the personal story behind that one. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:11:15] How did you know there was a first, there is definitely, I can, there are several I could say. and, That's very common.</p><p>I think you have to understand coming in as a specialist, that you will not be a very liked person to start with a, so let's take the example that happened to me. I started there about three years ago and you know how it is when you come in like your first days and you're walking around with like your bus or someone and getting introduced to a lot of new people, some UX designers, some product owners, and.</p><p>Then we walked around to say hello to the developers, coming onto one of the teams that worked with the CMS or the site. I said, hello to a guy called Amy and I got it and producing. This is Maryanne. She's our new CRO manager here. And at the time we had this AB testing and personalization tool called</p><p>Which had, had some issues, maybe not the tool, but the people behind it, before me. So I was introduced with a word saying this is Maryanne. She is starting to use CRO manager and ambulance response was, Oh, you're the new frost Mo </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:37] sure. You were already a many points behind, </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:12:41] definitely. Oh yes, definitely.</p><p>And I'm grateful that he said that in one way, because it made me, reflect a lot upon okay, so this is not an issue with me. Of course, not personally, but it is an issue that has been here before. So I needed to understand, what are those issues? How come you don't trust? The tool or what is it that you don't trust and why are you calling me a tool's name?</p><p>Is it really the tool or something else? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:12] good to know.</p><p>testing professionals, Nazi and product recommendation or blusher. , this is on the tax office clips for doing optimal performance. &nbsp;SiteSpect pushing 80 minutes for tagging. I think guns will flicker effect Dave and</p><p>in impact have opened our beta tester. Impressional Jayda, med SiteSpect</p><p>Yeah. And let's see, I think a lot of 'em. Also with a, with developers when you start out, they see it as an extra thing on top of their work, right? you're creating extra work for them, which they not necessarily like a while after, hopefully I'll throw a couple of months, they might realize, Hey.</p><p>but the sheroes are actually, trying to validate and test stuff. Before we build them or we build like an MVP and not the whole thing, but just an MVP. And that actually saves money. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:14:19] Yeah, definitely. I think like I totally get the developer side of things. I think it's okay. A big fortune that I come from that side as well, because a lot of people working with CRO, are creating AB tests on top of a code that is actually built by developers first place.</p><p>And they are the ones who are responsible for, if something breaks like everyone would call them. And they might think of, Oh, maybe this is this test. I need to call our CRO specialist about it, but they are responsible for it, but maybe they're not interlinked all the time as well as they actually shouldn't be.</p><p>So you really do need to think about that relationship. And making it AB test is just manipulating the code that is already existing on the website. learning how to code dynamically for AB testing so that you can safe fit so that you don't actually ruin the code on the site.</p><p>If they would make like an update or a release or something that's essential for having, I think, a secure or more risk-free CRL program </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:24] and, of, sorry, your second point, is running a master class. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:15:28] Yeah. Exactly. as to we, we have masterclasses in the house, everyone has them like whatever kind of area you're working within.</p><p>When I had created, some numbers, the closest stakeholders basically knew what zero was. Ah, then I asked if I could set up a master class just for Sarah to spread like the knowledge, because that's one of the most beautiful things would CRO is that it's so easy to show.</p><p>It's so easy to show inspirational cases from like Google or Netflix or whatever, great companies that are really driving this experimental culture. so just taking that, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:10] and so do people get, can they follow that from the whole company? your company is not in one office, so is it like an online masterclass that people can follow is like on demand or, periodically or has it worked?</p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:16:22] we do it physically and also we do it on, online. so it's live. So because I want to have that kind of interactive class, whenever I'm basically doing stuff. and also we have so much material now that we have tested all over to it. So basically in that master class, I can also ask them. So what do you want to see?</p><p>Because whatever area you're working in, you're interested in some part of the site. So then they can say, okay, I'm interested. And the checkout. Then I can just like that show them five tests that we did in the checkout so that they can get a greater understanding about what they actually care about.</p><p>And I think that will make the learning more fun as well. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:05] Yeah, exactly. And, and how do you get people then, to sign up for the masterclass? </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:17:11] we have an intranet where all the most classes are and add, we, have 40. Learning hours every year. So it's they really promote you going to these master classes to learn about all areas within the organization, which is great.</p><p>so you can sign up, for those just there or. I also tell people because some people come to me and they're like, Oh, I never see when they are on our intranet can just give me a note when you have them there. So you have to help out, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:40] it's already in your business culture to go to masterclass, that's already a thing.</p><p>So it's not just the zero mosque classes. There are master classes for all kinds of things. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:17:48] Yeah, definitely. But if you don't have that within your organization, a masterclass is basically an email invitation. A room or a digital setup and a PowerPoint. And you, you can do it.</p><p>you can just say I'm having a learning session for CRO, for our company sign up for it. It doesn't need to be that structured. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:09] Yeah. And how often do you do those? So mass classes, </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:18:12] I do them like four to a three to four times a year. Okay. So quite often, but. So in the beginning, like more people obviously come and then it will slow down.</p><p>But as I also want to say, it's keep that up and don't like, don't let them go. Of course you can do fewer as time goes by, but always keep them going because new people will come to the company and you want them on the same page too. So don't care that less people come because You wouldn't go to the same master class twice either.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:44] Exactly. No. So it's a similar Moscow clause, each time, but especially for a new ones is really interesting to invite those rights, to get them into the mindset of experimenting. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:18:54] Yeah. Because there, you really have the chance, right? Because they're new coming into the company to show them like, this is how we really want one to be and how we want to act and the culture we want to set.</p><p>Those are easier than the ones that have been with the company for 20 years. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:09] And then, the third one, the results and sharing those. So how do you do that? </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:19:15] It's a kind of a tricky one that, I set into several steps. Just that one actually, because the results is everything when it comes to the work of CRO, but mainly what I mean is that.</p><p>When you first do your, like the first AB tests, just gather like all the closest stakeholders, after every AB test is executed and sit down with them to actually show them the depth of the data and the insights, and also hear again, teach them about it. don't only go through like the top findings.</p><p>Teach them about what happened? What did we change in behavior? And also all of these stakeholders have like their own darlings. Everyone has. So if someone, I think it has changed, they probably, we will ask you like, okay, so more people signed up to the newsletter, but how many logged in? Because that's my darling.</p><p>I want to know. and then you can actually show them that you're so good at what you do and go into that analysis tool and show them the numbers while you're in the meeting, because then it also shows them the depth of what you can see. And you can also open up the floor and say, do you have any other questions?</p><p>Look at all this data, we can find out anything and you will get better ideas as well because you learn from the organization what's important. so that's one of the most important things I would say. About results. just taking that time with the people. 50% of the year or work is basically people who work so really engaged with them.</p><p>and also then later on that, open up the results to everyone and be transparent about them, so that you also get to share everything that you've been doing, but when your stakeholders have that understanding. Of the results, then let them see everything else you've done because then they can deep dive themselves, and grow away with even more.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:16] Yeah. And about opening up those, those results for everyone. how do you do that? How do you give access to everyone, to those results or instruction tools you use for that internally or. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:21:26] so we have a documentation online, which is basically a link that anyone within two we can access. Yeah.</p><p>So we have it in Atlassian, which is really convenient, for the documentation and some have it, in just a one drive folder or anything that you can share with the organization basically works. I would say then we also have a bigger like monitoring tool. That is also just with that link.</p><p>And the two of VPN, you can view everything that's online and how all the experiments are going right now. But we actually, didn't we didn't release that to everyone until maybe two years after I began at Stewie because. Seeing experiments when they are running, ask the stakeholder and the product owner, seeing one experiment, you're like, Oh look, it's up 20% after two days.</p><p>They will take actions on it directly. And we know that you should not do that. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:22:25] Becca uninformed ends our beta test and happy Oak lost from the beginning of flickering. A very artist did come through the key test. Tessa was not to be included and imposed if Tesco's that. No Tyler's year. be a convert, comes our beta testing software, the smart insert heat about any flickering of &nbsp;fifth gear Snelder support fee, a 24 seven jets.</p><p>The health would go up and, but dive is the last minute. If it was 15 key, carbon positive, you do this yourself. You have a knife and the fork and the &nbsp;during the</p><p>Yeah. So start there are, if the culture isn't there yet, there are risks and risks in sharing all the data. And showing if they don't have the context on what an experiment is, how it should be run and how that works, it's difficult. It might be, working against you if you share everything.</p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:23:19] Yeah, no, absolutely. yeah. I think you should be very careful and understanding what they are. What is their level of knowledge compared to what are you showing them? Yeah, in the beginning, I was really like, not sharing anything basically. So you say, for example, let's say you have executed an AB test.</p><p>You have it finished and you do the analysis. Then you invite the stakeholders to that, like first meeting or you are going to go through the analysis. In that like meeting notes or invitation, I will not, I would not share the PowerPoint presentation with them at first at all, or any results I want to be there care to explain the results.</p><p>Do them not just send them on the paper because everyone one will interpret that in their own ways. Yeah. Especially when you are not used to seeing these numbers. So at the beginning, I was very like holding back with what I was showing. And then as time goes by, and again, when you have been teaching them and when they have learned more and more, and their knowledge is getting bigger, then you can open up more and more as well.</p><p>So it goes to bed hand in hand. You have to be careful about that. I think </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:30] be aware of the level of knowledge of your direct colleagues and the people that you're showing this too. Okay. And, so you do use it lessons. So is it, does it make it searchable? Is it searchable for people and that's gender, the results from the test?</p><p>how do you handle that? that's an issue that I see a little shooter. I was struggling with. I have all these maybe power points. but how do I make it searchable so that in a year I can still find that test that I did. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:24:55] Yeah, no, I think that's very hard. I think a lot of that knowledge lies within the people who actually made the AB test.</p><p>Which is dangerous for the organization. And I think that's really tricky where we don't have a great solution right now. We're looking into some of them. we're doing that on. On the group level, which is the more like strategic, zero road. And, Yeah, I will take any tips that anyone possibly have because we're looking into several different possible solutions.</p><p>I have a big vision. I wanted searchable what labels, you want the winners and losers. You want everything to be searchable. I want all the tests from the past three months on the stock page, which were winners only on Facebook traffic, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:36] Yeah, exactly. Yeah. We all will. Not one.</p><p>Yeah. on to number four, Four, it's a weekly meeting that you do a, and then sharing what you learned this week, Or not necessarily you, but your team. Exactly. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:25:49] And that's the point that you said, it's not me. I have nothing to do with this meeting. The only thing I did was to set it up and I didn't even do that because I stole it from Luke &nbsp;Google.</p><p>I heard he was doing this with his team and I really loved the idea. So I thought, why not try it out? And everyone loves the meeting. So the meeting is basically all about what you learned this week, about the user. So it's a Friday meeting that a little fun thing to close the week, basically. And it's the people meeting.</p><p>This is the chance for everyone within my team or anyone else for that matter, who works with the user attitude to be able to. Get in there and show, what did you learn this week about our user? And that's a place where we share, of course, all the results that we have from the AB tests, that closed that week.</p><p>But it could also be like new user tests or heat maps or some other insights you have about like the whole user journey, basically. and it's also the important thing here is that this is a place for the people to actually shine. And lift up, what did I do? what did I do this week that I want to show off?</p><p>and not be as humble anymore, just like share it and brag a bit about it and get applause. And we're all happy for you. And, yeah, just want to bring that kind of fun and exciting feeling to it. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:27:18] And as I understood those weekly meetings also lead to a weekly newsletter. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:27:23] Yeah, exactly.</p><p>So after the meeting, I send out the CRO weekly, which is basically containing like what new tests are live, what tests are still alive since last week and what tests have been finished and which have been analyzed. And that's just a real, it's a one page, one page, your per experiment, basically.</p><p>so it's short. But it should be just an overview of, what the website is looking at right now, because everyone is so dependent on what the website is. And when you have a see that a bit in your experimentation program, and you have a lot of experiments live, a lot of them like taken down and then pushed back up and so on.</p><p>It's a lot of changes that's going on and I've noticed I'm getting more and more questions from From developers or from customer service or from other parts of the organization saying is this a test? Is this a test? Yes, my friend Amy tests, because everyone is getting different of the site.</p><p>Yeah. this is a way for everyone to be able to see, okay, what's the current setup of this app </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:33] this week, and also things that are not a test. that's usually my experience. When you started with a company that didn't do any AB testing before and you start AB testing. Then after that is when everyone knows there's AB testing on everything.</p><p>That's going wrong. Going wrong on the website. It's every little mistake it's Oh, let's ask the AB testing team or person. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:28:55] Exactly. no, it's totally like that. so this has proven to be really helpful actually. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:01] I think a struggle, at least I have an a, I know from other sheroes that when you weigh in trying to engage those people.</p><p>So you have a CRO newsletter that you send out to, to the company. how do you balance what you, if you overshare. They won't be reading it after a while anymore. They don't know what look. it's not the only newsletter people will get that. how do you balance that? how do you, what do you share and are there specific things that you don't share in those newsletters to not overwhelm them and to have them keep reading what they need to read?</p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:29:31] Yeah. So it should be very clear. I'm very sure this newsletter or, if they're interested in more, they have a link in the newsletter, which takes them to the documentation pages for kind of these tests. So this is basically very simple bill overview. this is the start page. These are the such tests.</p><p>This is the checkout and that's it. And even I don't. I want to make it clear, even from the start of kind of opening, opening it up, what are the highlights? So that people who know that, Oh, there's some highlight within my area. I should check on that. But if you're not highlighted that week, basically you don't have to check it if you don't have time.</p><p>So you should make it like really quick for people to understand </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:17] on to number five, zero showcase. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:30:20] Oh, yeah, the showcase. I like that one. I like all of them, of course, but the showcase is fun. the showcase is something I started with and have down net many workplaces. Now, it's a place at you. We started with it about two years ago.</p><p>And the showcase is a monthly meeting, basically where everyone's invited it's, both online and offline. and yeah, who do there is that we show off the greatest things we have learned by AB tests at jewelry during this month. And it's just a great place for, as you said, like these newsletters and weekly meetings, like you don't want to overload people with information, But to have something once a month where everyone can come, that's enough for a lot of people, the ones who are not on the newsletter or don't come to the weekly meetings, the ones who are a bit further from the CRO subject, but are still interested in what's going on with the site. those people are the ones who come to the CRO showcase, even our board members and very high management.</p><p>And, people also come to these meetings. And, so we had that within to Nordic for awhile. And then I had a conversation with, with a colleague from Belgium and he asked me like, Can I join your showcase next month? And I'm like, yeah, sure. By the way, do you want to show like a test then since you were like joining you're like a guest they're like, yeah.</p><p>Okay. Let's do that. And the next month, I think it wasn't the Netherlands who also wanted to join. And I said, do you want to share a test to then maybe? And then it was, it felt like you were a vision show or something like calling out to different markets and like welcome Germany. But then we just decided to rebrand it basically and make it into a global CRO showcase.</p><p>and to not sit there for five hours to talk about all the tests that we did. We said that each market can show like two to three tests that they have learned the most from, good or bad, but learned the most from during this month that they want to show. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:32:26] Yeah, exactly. that was what I was wondering.</p><p>So it's not only the winning dust at your show, right? </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:32:31] no. It's both the good, bad and ugly. Yeah, of course the ones you learned from the most are often the losers, right? Yup. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:32:41] Exactly. Online dialogue.</p><p>does ANet specialist</p><p>At team</p><p>and ultimately this year salmon Mecho</p><p>sales funnels and customer journeys. Mia info. Hi, now online dialogue, fentanyl. And then we have the, the sixth one, steps to get your experimentation, cultural running gloves. One is the monthly dashboard. I assume that's connected to the monthly meeting. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:33:24] Yeah, it is absolutely. They're both done on a monthly basis.</p><p>The monthly dashboard is something that we have worked a lot with during the past year. and I would say it has come from the global CRO role that I've had for a while. Now it's a way of trying to show higher top management. What is the actual value of, and would CRO. Like the million dollar question, and we have agreed to some primary KPIs that we are always looking at.</p><p>So in this monthly dashboard, we show how many tests were executed this month divided by market because we still work and divided by each market. So that's the one thing we're looking at. and then, sorry, we're also looking at something called a margin attribution value. So we're trying to look at if we would, implement this test a year ago.</p><p>Okay. How much margin would we have earned? So it's like a prediction modeling that we're working with a test that are the best and winners. So that's a margin revenue number we can actually bring forward. But we're also, as I said, like the losers are often the ones who learned the most from, so we also do, on the opposite side of it.</p><p>We also do the margin loss prevented. So we calculate the losing tests and how much we've actually prevented to if I'm losing, because we didn't implement that. Yeah, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:34:58] exactly. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:34:59] Yeah. So that's the monthly dashboard that we're displaying, but in there, we're actually also doing a bit of a fun twist to it.</p><p>So we're playing the monthly winner. So that's one AB test from all the markets that is announced as the winner for that month. It's a, it is the one with the most increased conversion rate or margin attribution, some of our top goals. Yeah, and this is just like adding a little bit spice and a small, like fun competition in there, like a friendly competition thing.</p><p>but it's also like a good, attitude. we have different websites today for Germany, Belgium, Sweden, et cetera. And this is also a very good, like learning thing for the other markets to see, Oh, you did this in like the search result then probably all the markets should prioritize that one for next month.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:35:50] Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And, and the copy and revalidate those, those experiments from other countries. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:35:56] Yeah, exactly. And then we have a, from that, now we have a great prioritization list with winning tests through months that we can follow up on. So it just gets bigger. I'd say, and you get a better view also around like different markets, what works and what doesn't work between different markets, but also very good and stable prioritization lists.</p><p>And the best data you can have, there is this is actually the same company that you're in, but in different markets you should probably test it. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:36:26] Yeah. The do already. Do you remember, any examples of that things that worked in one market and didn't work in another market?</p><p>Or </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:36:34] there are, I would say everything. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:36:39] That's also a good learning, right? So to revalidate everything in different markets. Yeah. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:36:44] I'd say so. I mean test that we've been doing the same once in UK and Nordics or in Belgium and UK and so on. They always have slightly differ in results. Yeah. Me having worked with like the Nordics also for three years, we're saying the Nordics, but it's actually for individual markets, it's, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, and we always have different results.</p><p>But saying that if you would, for example, go to the market then of UK, you could also say, okay, so UK has one result. That's not really true either, because if you drill down into demographics of UK, you will then get up the results. And within those groups, you have other results. Just a matter of how far do you want to drill it down?</p><p>And what results will you look at? That's why we have personalization. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:37:35] Yeah. So w we earliest spoke about leaving things out of, out of the things that you report, to stakeholders, if they're not educated enough, depending on the level that they are at, is it similar with the monthly dashboards or other things that are specifically not in there?</p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:37:50] So the things we, show in the Munsell dashboard, it's very narrow. It's actually only these like main KPIs that we do have. And then it's the link to the presentations that we now I'll have shown them because everyone can join it. And we want to create that person awareness and engagement from people, but it doesn't have to be that detailed.</p><p>So these presentations that we show are more like. Those have a storyline, which is like easier to understand for sure, for anyone. And then just more of an inspiration, basically. not that digging deep into the data. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:38:27] Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So my, thank you so much for sharing these six tips with us.</p><p>some of my final question for you will be, if you have any, do you have any books that you'd like to tip to our audience? </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:38:40] Yeah. I have one favorite book of all times. it's called the design of everyday things. Have you read it? Don Moore, Norman? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I think I read it at university. And since then I've read it like five times, I think.</p><p>it's also one of these books where you understand how stuff works from the beginning. Why do I understand to reach for a handle and how do I understand to push a door? And some of that book gave me clarity to understand and put words on what doesn't work. And I could actually understand what the problem is instead of only feeling frustration.</p><p>And I think that kind of. That is exactly the same, what CRO was, but with digital devices. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:39:27] Yeah. Yeah. I think, the book, we will definitely link to the book, in the show notes of the podcast. And I think the book has already, it's quite old already, right? It's it has nothing to do with the internet.</p><p>No, </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:39:38] nothing. They're talking about doors and lamps and everything, but you can figure out yourself and understand the connection between them. And that has, for me been a very good exercise that I did from the book, actually taking these words like affordance, for example, taking that from the physical world, a world and putting it into the digital one to understand.</p><p>Yeah. How are those gonna map together? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:40:03] Exactly. Yeah. A quick search, told me that the publication date is, 1988. So yeah, that's great. So it's the same principles, Then they're also trying to explain that to people. when I explained, so I have a background in psychology, how do you apply that in online?</p><p>And indeed the study had nothing to do with align, but it's still human behavior. it's still a lot of the same principles apply. And the nuances are different here and there. And of course we have a lot more data online, which is great. but it's still a human behavior that we're looking at and trying to optimize.</p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:40:36] Yeah. I think you do go back to where we started with this talk. Like you have to understand how this stuff works from the lowest building blocks to really understand why we are behaving as we are right now. Yeah, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:40:51] I think that's a great summary, Marianna. Thanks. You so much. Good luck with what you do and, good luck with, yeah, the whole situation with, within travel and tourism.</p><p>I hope it's a, we'll recover fast, fast enough to, for you to at least start rebuilding. </p><p>Marianne Stjernvall: [00:41:05] Yeah. Thank you so much. And thank you for having me. Thanks, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:41:08] bye. Bye. And that brings us to the special new section I mentioned in the intro, our sponsor contents, crass, quite some clients, and quite some data on things like traffic sessions, dime transactions and conversion rates split over 20 industries and a couple of other dimensions.</p><p>And the amazing thing is that they have. But all of this in a public dashboards and they are closely monitoring the effects of the dynamic only commerce giving us some very detailed insights, how these different industries are effective. So from this week on worth, we'll have a small section in the podcast in which they will update us on the latest developments.</p><p>Say hello to &nbsp;from content square </p><p>Tjeerd van der Putten: [00:41:49] to provide understanding. During this uncertain time, we are monitoring the impact of Corona virus from online consumer behaviors. Every week we analyze billions of online sessions across 900 websites to understand online behavior and to see what trends are unfolding across all industries this week.</p><p>To understand the impact of the crisis on traffic transactions, they choose and more we've compared data from the past week to the period immediately preceding the global reporting of the outbreak or the first six weeks of the year, which we call the reference period here is what we service the past week.</p><p>Generally speaking, it seems to the story this week is stabilization. We've seen a steady growth as digital continues to be the only store which has started to level off this week. Here are three key stats. Traffic overall continues to grow steadily it's slowly with a two and a half percent increase compared to 2% the previous week.</p><p>This steady growth over the past two months has resulted in a 29% increase in the number of site visits since before lockdown transactions globally. And cross industries has grown by a massive 48% since the first quarantine orders. And after an initial period of rapid growth, the conversion rate has now stabilized at around 15 to 20% above normal pre COVID-19 levels.</p><p>So we're seeing growth that has significantly at seeding the numbers we are seeing pre COVID and this week stabilization can start to give us an idea of what the new normal will look like for online brands. Now, we will take a quick, deep dive into three industries that have had some interesting trends this week.</p><p>And examples from brands who are getting it right. The luxury industry has had some interesting peaks this week. Luxury rents were one of the first to be effected when COVID first spread to ship to China, the country who citizens accounted for 90% of global luxury market growth in 2019. However, the industry has started to take a turn luxury brands have seen a 5% increase in visits to their sites in the past week and the 90% boost.</p><p>In the volume of transactions, we have seen many of our luxury clients, launch corporate social responsibility messaging with brands, such as Tiffany and co burglary and bell staff implementing strong homepage campaigns. Belstaff a luxury British clothing brands are offering to donate a jacket or every jacket bought on their side to the homeless.</p><p>They ran an homepage campaign, which has resulted in a huge increase of interactions with the content and users who interacted with the content were 40% more likely to purchase. It's been great to see all the different social initiatives, luxury brands have been launching, and it seems to be paying off a win for both customer and the community.</p><p>Second off is travel. It's been the hardest effected industry by far, but this week we have seen signs of growth and recovery. The travel and tourism companies are starting to see an increase in time, spent by users on their website this week, although still 25% below normal. But this is a great sign for companies that users are starting to consider transacting.</p><p>Again, this industry has taken the hardest hit in terms of transactions where the steep drop of 88% of the whole covert period. However, the last three weeks we've seen an improvement. With an increase of transactions of 14%. This week as locked down, rules are loosened and users are more hopeful. This is a great time to start encouraging your customers to start booking for future dates.</p><p>Many of our clients have launched summer 2021 campaigns with great engagement rates. Lastly, moving on to an ever popular industry. During this time, supermarkets e-commerce has had the most dramatic story of all from a spike pre quarantine of three times. Normal traffic. To massive conversion rate declined due to delivery and supply chain issues with brands.</p><p>Now, responding to these changes this week, supermarket websites continue to see a traffic search with 133% boost, but more interesting transactions are seeing a big significantly. For home and do it yourself. DEC and sport products. Conversion rates suffered a cut of 50% back in March, but has recovered since then.</p><p>And this week we are at just minus 13% below the precollege levels. We've seen some really interesting innovations by supermarket brands, for example, Tesco in the UK. Effort back to shelf button, which place when products are out of stock, we assuring users that similar items are available. This is a common theme we are seen in the, in this industry with COVID delivered three and product reassurance, playing a huge part in reducing user frustration.</p><p>So that's all from us this week.

Last April, he and Joris launched at Dutch book about online influence. And this was such a big head that they're now launching the English version of that book. Together with nobody less than Robert Cialdini himself. In this episode, we looked to poor. What makes us different from the books and content that you already know from</p><p>and how you can join the launch webinars and both things about the Netflix series, the social dilemma. My name is Peter Nelson. And welcome to this hero podcast.

SiteSpect online influence Institute.</p><p>Content square and comforted.com. Welcome to season two, episode 42 boss. Welcome back to the show and what a numb that she's amongst those that don't know who you are yet. Why are you the person writing this book? </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:01:58] Why am I the person that writing this book? my career started off, in the online influence business.</p><p>I had a company and it wasn't a kitchen industry and this grew. Two very successful business, which I could saw good self, in 2016. And afterwards I get in touch with dr. Cialdini and I became one of his, 19 certified trainers in the world. And actually last week they said goodbye to a few trainers.</p><p>So now the only 14 certified trainers from him in the world. Which one, I am one of them. I'm also afterwards trained by BJ folk, the man who invented the term behavioral design. So I think a combination of knowledge and practical proven applicability makes me the guy </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:02:50] you're the guy. but to be fair, You have a co you have a co-writer for this book, it's all lonely.</p><p>yours couldn't be here today, but, can you give us a short introduction of your sister background? </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:03:02] Yes yours, of course, just as important. I am. Yours is a psychologist and he has a 20 year experience in applying proven behavioral science for better online results. And he did this for big brands like KLM Coca-Cola ING bank, and many more.</p><p>So he has a great track record and he has an amazing of knowledge and skills. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:03:25] So it's great combination, if I may, life as it. So you were more to the theory and yours is more to the practical side of the practical experience, or </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:03:34] we both get the call and also have a theoretical foundation only from a different perspective, your work a lot for the bigger brands and set up campaigns.</p><p>And I was more like an entrepreneur. Made it happen in my own companies. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:03:48] And now you're writing a book about online influence. I think you already had a nice quote for that, but, as many people might think, okay, but don't, we already have books on online influence. why would we need another book?</p><p>And, maybe let's start off with the quote you got, as a result of the previous podcasts that we did. Someone being skeptical about this. </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:04:09] That's a great story. I got a LinkedIn message a week ago from a CRO specialist from Allianz. And, he sent me a really cool case data.</p><p>So I, I reached out to him and we spoke on the phone and he told me I listened to your podcast. It's a hundred percent fair. You won this amazing award. So again, my, congratulations, but he reached out with a really cool, cool. A B test and, So we started talking and he told me he listened to your podcast.</p><p>And then he, was quite skeptical. I thought, there are so many books. And I read books from Ghana mom, and I read the book from Cialdini. what is more out there, but because he's such a fan of the field of work, he just ordered the book. And when he starts reading, he told me, he said I was done completely in one rush.</p><p>I read through the book because it read really easy and it was. New stuff. And, the pool, his part was when he came back to Alianza, they had, a challenge to upgrade the number of reviews. So he directly applied our suggestions and the first AB test there was directly successful in the, had an increase in reviews from 28 point 45%.</p><p>So that's a nice story because I can get the skeptical side and. What we wanted to do. We want not to prove the science again. There's a lot of books out there who approved the science behind how behavior. So we come from a perspective. Yeah, we know there's science out there for people who never heard of the science.</p><p>We shortly explain it. And then we make the statement, okay, assume this is the truth, because this is not our good ideas. It's not the good ideas of people who wrote books about is this is built on more than a hundred years of research around the globe. Only we want to make it practical. And I think that's the big difference from our book.</p><p>It's a complete practical guide. How you can upgrade your online results based on the BJ fault model. And I think we are the first one in the world who use this model in a book. And translate it to online and give the reader design principles for each of the actions of the beat access of the BJ fault model.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:06:30] So it contains,</p><p>contains a bit of a , but you also try to apply this to a practical standpoint. So the intended audience seems to be a bit different than maybe those books are, as, children, he wrote his first book, was 1980. Two or three, a long time ago. there was no online, I assume a lot of those, examples in the books that you have, in English version are still also applied to online.</p><p>I haven't read the English version yet. </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:07:00] Yeah. Yeah. Like you would have the Dutch version and it's the translation with a minor change in some examples, because in the Dutch version, we of course use some Dutch companies, which we changed to more international companies or the theory. And our advisor stays the same, </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:07:18] but the intended audience for this it's very practical.</p><p>Is it like, is it, digital marketeers? That's the audience? Is that the, </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:07:24] everybody. Who wants to increase their online results is our audience. And that could be from an online marketeer. Who's really doing the work or copywriter or a UX design, also a manager or even a. Chief marketing officer could be the audience of all forms perspective to guide their people or to be creative designing campaigns.</p><p>So I would argue our book is fateful. Anybody who wants to increase the online, </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:07:58] it is mainly for online, users. would you say it's also. Does it mean it's not applicable to offline all the examples or would it also be just as well? It's just happens to be very, being applied to online. </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:08:13] Really good question.</p><p>Actually, I would say everybody could benefit from reading our book. of course we translate the theory to all line, but if with a slight imagination you could translate it to. A sales conversation to talking with your friends who you want to, persuade of believing something or doing something.</p><p>So it's a pluggable all out your life. I would say only we translate the theory into online examples, but behavior design, behavioral science, and it's based on how. Our decisions and behaviors comes to life. So this. Does not only is applicable for online. This is just everywhere in our daily life </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:09:03] for over 10 years.</p><p>Now, all my dial-up advisors about evidence-based conversion optimization with a focus on data and psychology. We see that analyzing data and recognizing customer behavior results in a better online dialogue with your clients and a higher ROI that team of strategists, analysts, psychologists, and UX specialists.</p><p>Gathering valuable insights in online behavior of your visitors and together with you, they optimize the different elements of your Ciro program through redesign expert reviews, AB test and behavioral analysis. For more information about their services, go to Oman dialogue. Let's go. It's funny how we now say okay.</p><p>yeah, what happens online? It's still. human behaviors. So we can also apply it offline while at the beginning of my career, I had to explain the opposite. I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah, we do. The oldest Alzheimer's also works online. Really. It's still human behavior </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:09:57] change really quickly. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:09:58] Exactly.</p><p>Exactly. yeah, the comment that, that stood out, you just said, For Molly also, I read through it, in one go, I read a couple of reviews of the ditch version of the book. I think that was a common review that at this stood out for, for me, because usually. those books are more like a manual and say, okay, I'll currently, I'm struggling with our XYZ campaign.</p><p>Let's go into the book, a page 300. Oh, that's about, I don't know, email campaigns. Let's go through the practical steps and apply it. It doesn't necessarily. Those books, usually, don't just, you don't start reading at the front. And, one day later you're at the back, finished the book. That's usually not what happens.</p><p>So that's I think, really stands out already. Can you tell us a bit more, how did the first batch go in, afforded that version? </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:10:44] Yeah. In the Netherlands, we were super pleased with, winter launch. We were sold out with the first batch on pre-orders. the demand for the topic, was quite high and it was of course a great for us.</p><p>And, after our launch, we were 30 days, the number one best seller on the management book bestseller list. So that was really successful launch. We were, of course, really pleased with. and what I even more pleased was, of course you want to sell the book, but what you want really want</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:11:21] reviews behaviors. So we can also apply at the beginning of my </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:11:25] career, explain your success. They could make their clients happier. They could let the business grow. So we got great comments and that's really. Made us really </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:11:36] happy. Do you think, the whole pandemic situation, that it's, does it help your book or did you see more people have time to read or something or?</p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:11:45] I won't argue I'm pro COVID, but our topic. Yeah. I think it definitely helped us because suddenly everybody was doing things or wine. I corporates who weren't used to working from distance, suddenly had to. So the topic online influence. Once I think it couldn't be off then in another timeframe than now.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:12:08] Exactly. And now in English version. So w why are you making an English version? Is it wasn't always the intention to do an English version or? </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:12:15] Yeah. Yes. It was always our intention. And, because my connection with, over Cialdini, we spoke about it. during we were writing the book in touch. We all.</p><p>Already translated to English show Cialdini, look what we are writing. And we collaborate on the book. So it was always the attention to it in English. but of course, because of the success and the time period where we live now, we speed it up the launch. So actually we launched in April and all the ones.</p><p>So now six months later, we already have a plead translation with. New examples and, ready to launch English version internationally. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:12:59] Yeah. And as I understood, it's not going to be acquired launch. </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:13:01] I hope so. We'll be quiet. No, we're going to do everything we can to make this a big celebration for us, but also for everybody who will join us at the webinar for the launch, because we invited, Over Cialdini.</p><p>And he was actually pleased to join us for the full one and a half hour. people get free access to Cialdini, which is quite unusual. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:13:26] of course </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:13:28] he is open for questions from the audiences. He will tell a really cool story about himself, but most people don't know before he. Describes his six principles.</p><p>I laid her on the seven principles of persuasion. He was undercover actually for more than three years and he will set up this undercover story, how we did it and what happened during this time. So that thing, that's a great story to listen to. Also, he will share his favorite online influence example, and he will share what his, in his opinion is the best.</p><p>Principal from his seven principles to use online. That's the Cialdini part. So he is fully on board, which is great. We will set out to highlight from a book and a minimum of 15 case study to inspire all the participants for day, their next marketing campaign. And we want to be out there. So we will be, we will be live at the New York times.</p><p>We will be in the economist. We will do a lot of, big campaigns. I just was talking to you. And I said, we will aim in our social targeting for over 40 million views. So we hope that a lot of people will join us for this celebration of </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:14:43] mobile. And, children and joining that's a, that's already unique.</p><p>You don't see him online, that much, for, especially not only in a free webinar. Do you actually know how much, children he works for, online companies, </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:14:56] how much time he's been asked to train them or? </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:15:00] Yeah, usually his books and, he's in a cover story. th those are mostly based on offline, offline, persuasive tactics.</p><p>So has he been working lately with a lot of online stuff? Do you know? </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:15:10] Yes. I know actually, Cialdini is revising his, book on influence and, It's asked by his publisher to do a last version and youth more online influence samples. And actually we returned the favor reciprocity work examples.</p><p>Yeah. Yeah. Also Danny asked our advice to get as much as examples as possible to use in history. First revised version of </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:15:38] influence. I would like to know a bit more about the content of the bookers itself. what w what can readers expect to learn from it? assuming for example, that they already know about that already to read the children's book, they already know about the BJ folks, a model.</p><p>what does the was x-ray in the book besides the practicality, but what are the things that we are going to learn? </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:15:59] Yes. happy to discuss. I'm also happy you brought up this topic because my connection with Cialdini is sometimes people think, Oh, they write a book and they put Cialdini's principle in an online code.</p><p>That's not what we've done. Of course. It's principles are named in the book, but not the full seven, only four. So let me explain what's inside the book as a foundation, the BJ Fogg behavioral model. I don't know if all listeners are familiar with the model, so I will quickly explain it. The model of BJ fork.</p><p>Explains how behavior comes to life. So he said, as behavior comes to life, when people are in the same time, motivated enough to do it, they have the ability. It's easy enough to do it. And there's a prompt at that same moment for the desired behavior of all these things. Three factors, aren't the right balance.</p><p>People will do a certain behavior. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:16:58] Marketing Reggie's have suffers. And the sheriff for AB testing has been impacted too. If you want to keep that thing to enterprise standards, but save 80% on your annual contract, you can consider comfort, but there's summer release. You can take advantage of full stack and hybrid features, strong privacy compliance, no blink.</p><p>And enterprise grade security feel good about your smart business decision in Fest? What you save back in your CRO program, check out www &nbsp;slash 2020 BJ folk has a behavioral formula for this. Saying these three things need to be in place, or at least, in a high enough volume they need to be, available before behavior occurs.</p><p>And, w we'll show we'll get a, at a link to the show notes. if you want to quickly look at, the graph, for that. </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:17:52] Yeah. Yeah. that will be great. So that's our basic foundation and then. We make decisions. So we explained that based on current amounts research is the one system too.</p><p>I won't deep dive too much because I think the most of your listeners are familiar with his work. I also, </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:18:09] yeah, if not, again, no shame there. we'll have links in the show notes explaining those, those things. </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:18:16] Yes. So some show notes and what we've done. We make choices based on what they call psychology eristics and biases.</p><p>and we have Hondas of your risks and biases, which we often see. on webpages, then they say, Oh, we have this juristics and these biases, this is how you can use it online, blocks, fully written, but it has no structure. So our structure is the four behavioral model and we took the 37 principles that we know from our own practice are highly successful to upgrade your results.</p><p>And we put them on this access. I think the most unique and I never saw any broad about it is that we also described. Cool techniques. We described several techniques to make the most efficient phones. So the thing that asks for the behavior, first of all, it needs to get attention. If people don't see your prompt, they will never build a behavior.</p><p>You are, </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:19:11] your website itself, it can be very user-friendly, it can be, persuasive as hell, but. If no one knows about your website, if they're not prompted to go there, no, one's going to buy it from you. </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:19:23] Simple examples of that go to your website. You will never get any covert version. Of course.</p><p>And then you have the other side, if you overpromise people. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:19:32] Yeah. Usually it's the other way around, right? when I started, doing conversion optimization for a lot of companies, Usually the traffic is not the issue. they're buying a lot of the traffic, but then people get stuck on their websites either.</p><p>There's a lack of ability or like lack of motivation. They are prompted they're on the website and then they're like, okay, now what? </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:19:49] Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So we have a married one, one case that you will hear about in the webinar they join is for example, with a small, simple change, how say up the comment factory upgraded conversion with 2000% just.</p><p>By thinking on a different prom strategy and, another, lovely case about forms, which I can explain. It's in Holland too, we have open calm. That's basically our Amazon and, this campaign, yours did, and he won the first CRO award in the Holland, in the Netherlands, the conversion rate optimization award by changing their forms.</p><p>How to get, how to ask for a review and the number four reviews doubled. So also this case, we will explain how we did, but I think this, the really unique thing in our book, because I didn't see blocks somewhere before, when we did some research that describes prompts strategies. So that's I think an outstanding part from our book.</p><p>Then the next one I think is outstanding. Get, we learn people to do problem solving. If people don't do what we want them to do, whether it's offline or online, we always think they are not motivated enough to do what we want to do, but actually according to BJ folk and according to our own research, that's the thing, the other way around.</p><p>So fortunate. Formula is B is map motivation, ability, prompt. But if you do problem solving, you go from front ability to motivation, probably just stop. But the ability is something really interesting because actually you make your desired behavior easier to do, or because it's easier often your visitors will be much happier with your website.</p><p>So it works two ways. So that's interesting. And, of course we know how to boost motivation in the moment, just in the moment before making a decision only this is the hardest part. And also there are not, there's also not too much really content in an online way that people say, okay, motivation is the hardest part because research motivational ways I could wake up and it could be very motivated.</p><p>To work out. And when I see myself in the mirror, I think boss, you need to work out more, but the same day I could sit on a terrorist in the sunshine and think, I like a beer and a steak it's conflicting, but this is how motivation works. So motivation is never on the same level to do something. If something is easy, it always takes.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:22:33] Yeah. and motivation. Doesn't always. the domain, the term motivation, often seems to mean Oh, I want to do something, but it doesn't necessarily in this context, doesn't necessarily have to mean that way. The exact same thing. The example I usually give is, filling in your tax papers.</p><p>Almost no one is motivated to do this properly. but you are in terms of this formula, you are motivated to do it there. to do it on the website of your local tax, institution, because that's the only way. And it also works with, if you want to buy a product, maybe you're not necessarily motivated to do it at someplace, but if that's the only place you can get this product that you want, you are very motivated in that sense to buy it there because that's the only option you have.</p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:23:15] Absolutely. And then the last example is a great example of the scarcity principle, which definitely is in the motivational acts. I like to say this. Because this is really great stuff, but you're talking about Hito and also with taxpayers, you're not pretty motivated to do but if you don't do it, you can get some penalties or pay more interest and that's the motivator to start leaving it.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:23:42] Yeah. it's the motivation here is not the carrot, but it's a stick. So we're talking about online persuasion and, persuading people to change their behavior. you may have heard of, the social dilemma on Netflix. so what's your stand in this? I don't know if you've seen it, but you probably know, at least what it's about that there is not.</p><p>Necessarily a lot of people that like to be influenced whether it's online or offline. so what's your stance on it? Stand on this. </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:24:11] We going to talk here about ethics. We also described the check the about ethical use of this, principles in our book and my stance. If I answer, before I answer your question, I will put a general stent point of view.</p><p>You cannot argue in my opinion, whether this. Principals are ethical or not, because it's just scientific research that shows how we make choices. I think the outcome and what you do with it is if it's ethical or not, we did five, six things in our book, way, in our opinion, it's a minimal checklist, that you need to can answer with.</p><p>Yes. To say it's ethical. And one of that discretion is a basic question, for example, is it true? What I say? Would I tell this to my father model brothers or sisters? </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:24:59] it depends a bit on your relationship with your family. Maybe you have a good relationship.</p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:25:08] That was the starting point. But otherwise you can say your best friend or, but then you get again &nbsp;yes. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:25:18] And any person you, you have in a high regard, and we'd like to be honest with </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:25:22] yeah. That's the best Raven. I know, of course. Is it wise? It's for example, and why should we mean if this person now does what I asked him to do?</p><p>Would he want to do something for me the next time? The answer is no, probably you shouldn't do this request. Now back to your question about the social dilemma. Of course, it's a complicated thing. I think as these companies, we know they really base their strategies on behavioral science. And if the outcome is you get paid, make people addictive.</p><p>And even that goes so further on the people commit suicide. I think you have to take a responsibility and do something about it because this could never be the ID behind the first launch of this app. The first idea was always to do something good for people. And when it from something good, because. It becomes something bad.</p><p>I think you have to redesign your ID, </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:26:28] but you, but just say, okay, these principles, that just based on science, the principles itself are not necessarily good or bad. but you could also say, okay, but we don't necessarily know how human behavior works perfectly. the things we do know those are, maybe we know 5% of it.</p><p>I don't know. maybe it's. 80%. I don't know. I don't know what depends on the range, in the measurement you do, but we don't have a complete picture. I think we can agree on that. We don't have a complete picture on how human behavior works. so isn't it unethical to start with, if you want to try to change it, if we don't have the full picture.</p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:27:05] Yeah. Good question. And I think I, yeah, I agree with you, especially we. Come to understand more and more of this material, especially with neuroscience. Now, of course they really see what parts of the brain light up and which parts doesn't. So we see more and more interesting. Research, but yeah, I agree with you that's that, but the ethical part is always some gray area.</p><p>I think for some things is this is still ethical and a lot of person could argue, this is totally unethical already. &nbsp;</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:27:42] worldwide unique, AB testing, personalization and product recommendation solution SiteSpect works service sites without any tags or scripts, which guarantees an optimal performance, the SiteSpect solution eliminates delays and the chance of any flickering effects.</p><p>And this approach also ensures that the current and future browser stretcher rules like ITP and ETP don't make an impact on your AB testing and personalization for more info visit &nbsp;dot com. Interesting one. And it depends on your perspective if already, if you think if that's a goal ethical alarm, so that's already making, it's a very difficult to discretion.</p><p>And another thing to add. I always say people, when people tell me how, but it's not, nice to be, to do to apply a persuasion or something, but it's impossible not to do, to apply persuasion. You always try to persuade something. The person telling me this, it's trying to persuade me to change my behavior.</p><p>So in the way you clothe yourself, the way you look, the way you dress. the way you communicate anything, it's all persuasive. </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:28:48] I completely agree. I often argue indeed that almost any conversation we have, there is some goal about this conference </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:28:57] with trying to get people, to buy a book now, to go to your webinars.</p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:29:04] We don't want to pay them money yet. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:29:06] It's just a free webinar. But that's the whole point, right? It's not necessarily, there's no non persuasive communication. I mean that's going to be a really hard not to include any persuasion in there. Especially doing this research online and your book is a good example of that in trying to understand the, those impacts that we do, I think is way more important, than just trying to ignore it and then just do whatever I think that's way more riskier, right?</p><p>And then you try to influence behavior and you don't base it base basically on any research that can have way more, bigger adverse effects. then if you don't take those into account </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:29:46] completely, I agree. And even I dare to argue that also the person that we want to persuade, if you tell almost information, the receiver of this information will be happy with this information.</p><p>When I book a hotel and the number of reviews and the reviews are true, I'm happy that I can read them because I can make a better choice. if I want to go to a super nice restaurant and I know this is the last table that I can reserve for this time and this date. And I notice, I really happy that I know it's often scarcity is often used in a false way.</p><p>Only, but when it's true scarcity, I want to notice because I can make a better choice myself as well. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:30:31] Exactly. Yeah. Can I still buy this if you are not? I don't want to know if it's truly the last one I really want. </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:30:36] So I, it also helps people to make better choices and that's the ethical part.</p><p>And then it's what, like we said, it's a gray area, but we, in our book, we. Describe this, and we give six questions as a guideline to the reader. I think these six basic guidelines should help people to get win-win situations. And as long as that's your goal, your client is happy and you can make money or you have a better reputation or what's the outcome for the company or for the other person is when, as long as it stays, win-win these principles.</p><p>Work </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:31:13] for everybody. Exactly. I think that the biggest issue, that people have with it is maybe even when it's win-win the win for the other party might be much bigger. And, and if that's clear, that's fine. But if that's, if that's not obvious, if people are kept in the dark about what the actual.</p><p>The motivations of the other party are if that's obscured, maybe intentionally. So then that's where people find themselves. </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:31:37] Exactly. And then again, we go back to this question already mentioned if this wise to present it like this, because you're intentionally, setting up a deal when somebody finds out later that he starts hating you.</p><p>What really? The answer, the question is it wise to do should be no. And then we advise people go back and redesign your </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:31:58] office. Yeah, probably if you, want to figure out that I was reading this article about how to handle this, with, with kids when they're persuaded in, into, showing these repeat behavior, Hanging on Dick, talk for hours talking about case, but my girlfriends do it doing the same.</p><p>but it helps to take a person out of that conversation, out of that behavior at an ask them. Okay. What are your, what do you want to achieve this year or with school? Do you want to succeed in school? Yes, I want to succeed. Okay. But then. Then you need to do your homework or you need to study for something.</p><p>Yeah. I need to study. Does it help, achieving that goal if you're on tick-tock for hours? no it doesn't. So then you see, and you can do this, of course, also with, the clients that you have to figure out, are we actually helping them or not? if they, if you take them out of this behavior and will they still actively choose to do do you think that it helps them in that way?</p><p>And, I think that's. Probably has a way bigger effect on the long-term for your long-term success as a company, if you actually provide that long-term value than when it's only short-term, effects. But I think that the, a big problem there with lots of competition, I think with Facebook and tick-tock and.</p><p>of course those are the favorable, and, but I think that's almost at any company that the incentives that we all see as employees at a company, those are often short term incentives. </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:33:17] Completely agreed. that's also human behavior again. only I know from a true fact, if you have a longer run and a long it's already, if you take something for a year and not only tomorrow, A year is pretty sure you can do outstand.</p><p>You can bring outstanding more success for your company. Then your only think what will happen tomorrow. That's argue. And then a year is quite short. I want to add something either because it's just pops up in my mind. You mentioned these big companies, Facebook take talk. we know the Netflix, Amazon.</p><p>And often people think, ah, this material is only for them. They have the budgets, they can hire all these smart people and they have these big teams. And actually, I want to say to all the listeners, that's not true because in our book we describe such simple changes that is from buying even costly. And otherwise it's at a really small budget.</p><p>With huge outcome from Cialdini. They know he knows the names, it a small, big, so a small change, big outcome. And actually, I want to, there's a lot. I like to share with the listeners, everybody who understands this material can. Great to success, whether you have a big budget or a small, </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:34:40] there are a lot of practical examples right?</p><p>in the book. So you can apply this. And this is also Mendez as like a guidebook. we already discussed people are just reading through the whole book. Can I also just, is also meant for, to be on my desk the whole time. and I, Oh, Hey, I'm currently designing this.</p><p>Let's go to the book. Is it? </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:34:58] Yeah. Thanks for asking it because the answer is clearly yes. We want to re write a book, that you can have on your desk. And this is how it builds. We go from these excess, just like we talked about, then we have a chapter about choice architecture and I'm probably the last.</p><p>30% of the book is only practical application. You can go to a chapter, how to design email for tide and how to design a display ad, or how to design a landing page or checkout page. And you'll get an advice and completely at the end of the book, we have a checklist that I checked all these questions, and we have a list with ideation problems.</p><p>So ask yourself these questions to inspire yourself. To make your next campaign better. So definitely yes, a book. what we would like that you put on your desk and use it on a daily basis? </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:35:51] My final question, on the book itself, I assume there's no sexual. Buying behavior during pandemics.</p><p>But if you would add a chapter, sir, on that specific, topic for businesses preparing, maybe for the upcoming holiday season, during this, this, dynamic, what would you write for them? What would you advise them during a </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:36:10] pandemic? It's a good question. What would I find? Of course, it's little bit, different advice to the industry you are, because at the moment, if you are a restaurant or a travel agency, I will give you a different advice than, probably the industry where I came from the kitchen industry, because this industry is growing rapidly actually, because everybody is at home.</p><p>different advice, I would, certainly. Advise them away of frustration to have the right communication with the employees and the clients, and maybe ability also focused on the ability, maybe ability to stay in touch and to let your clients approach you and let your people approach your clients, design this, and also an ability what I think, but I think most companies already done.</p><p>Make sure your employees who work now from home, have a good ability to do their work from home. That's probably the best advice I can give at the moment to, through a lot of companies. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:37:16] Yeah. And especially now that things, seem to take on a bit longer than, than we may have expected in the beginning.</p><p>You can say, okay, for three months we can all make it work. But if it takes a long time, then, frustrations might, might rise. and things gets, Yeah, you got frustrated with, things faster maybe now that you're, working from a distance, maybe it can be described description itself can also be the chair you're sitting on.</p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:37:41] Yeah, exactly. That's things that increase the ability because in the beginning you can boost yourself. So you are motivated to always set a home office, but now it's running for months. And I think still, I hear people talking, I doubt. Where are people working as hard from home, and then again, they go back to the motivational impact.</p><p>Make it, the ability for your employees to work from home really high and they will see better results. There will be a behavior design at five that I will give them during this pandemic. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:38:17] the webinar will be an, on the 28th, right? October 20th. where do people go to subscribe? </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:38:23] October 28, 7:00 PM.</p><p>Amsterdam time? that means 1:00 PM. New York time. they go to online influence.com/webinar. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:38:35] And again, it's free, right? </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:38:36] It's free home percent free, no strings attached, and you get full access, to a lot of business cases to Robert Cialdini, we will do an online influence quiz. If you win this quiz, you get to answer your personal question.</p><p>To dr. Cialdini himself. So it will be a lot of celebration moments if it's </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:38:55] my suggestion for the question will be a what's preservation principle, number eight. </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:39:00] Wow.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:39:05] Thank you so much. If people already think, Hey, maybe this book is something for me and I already want to buy the book. where did they </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:39:11] go also to online influence.com? Yeah. Slash book, or just go to online influence.com and see in the navigation, the book will have the link. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:39:21] Perfect. And we'll also have the add these links of course, to the show notes of, of this podcast.</p><p>one of my final questions for you, boss, w what is an insight, maybe, also created, during the process of writing this book? What's the insight that you think, you may have that you, think others. In our outside Ciro, may not have, </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:39:39] I already told at one time a journey in this podcast, but I think a big insight, should be people don't do what you want them to do.</p><p>Don't first start to boost motivation. First, check your prompts, then check. Can we make it easier for the visitor to do and as last thing or motivation? </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:39:59] Yeah. So first you need to figure out where the actually getting stuck. Yes. Not necessarily where, but also why. Whereas </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:40:07] in the moment that we want to want a person to do a certain behavior, is there a prompt that asks for his behavior?</p><p>Yeah. And often if you ask that basic question and then the second question is this the best prom strategy? If you ask those two questions, you go already often increase conversions and quite easily and costly. Oh, of course effectively. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:40:34] and, thank you. thank you for that. Boston, my final question for you.</p><p>I have a feeling you're going to suggest, but, who should I invite for the upcoming an, an upcoming Ciroc Fe episodes? And, what should I ask them? </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:40:46] I that's an easy one. Of course, he though, that will be global Cialdini. And you have to ask him about his eight principles. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:40:53] exactly.</p><p>Yeah. actually both. I've heard you are a very well trained in persuasive principles, so I assume you will be able to persuade him to come on the podcast. </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:41:03] I'm going to definitely ask it for you. Thank you. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:41:07] Thank you so much for, for joining me on the podcast. we'll definitely check it out.</p><p>we'll subscribe to the webinar. I hope to see you there and maybe we'll figure out what the eighth principles </p><p>Bas Wouters: [00:41:18] that will be. Great. Thank you for being here. He though it was lovely. Again, speaking with you, </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:41:24] talk to you soon. Bye-bye.

So I wanted to make things a bit easier for those that are interested in a podcast on CRO, but don't speak Dutch.</p><p>So what you can do is go to Sierra Delta cafe slash English, and there, you will find all the English contents on that page. You can also subscribe to risk Coopertino mail that will notify you when an English episode goes live. And if you don't mind the verge contents, you can of course subscribe to the podcast in your favorite podcast app, which will give you all the Dutch and English contents.</p><p>So thanks for tuning in and let's get started with this episode.</p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:01:01] yeah, my name is Simo. I'll have a, I'm a blogger, I think first and foremost. that just happens to be invited to speak at events for some reason about Belgium, about protein. I want to talk about project more and more, but nobody invites me for that </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:15] ever a written blog posts about Bill's him. </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:01:19] Damn I haven't.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:20] Yeah. That's where you're </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:01:20] stuck. I know. </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:01:21] I'll have to Jesus business idea for light bulb. Why have I not written by Paul jam? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:27] Exactly. I'll do it. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:01:30] Yeah, I'm Tom, I'm a blogger. I won't call myself a blocker anymore. I do still write articles even in like debt-free paper stuff. yes, that's the list of one I'm more community enabler or something like making things happening.</p><p>Evangelists in this industry, maybe evangelists too. That's a tough term evangelists, and I'm not trying to convince people who don't believe I'm hopefully enabling people to do believe to become better in this </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:02] fair enough. Fair enough. And Simo, you had a keynote this morning, about browsers mainly.</p><p>Yeah. So what was your main point? What do you want to. </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:02:11] Oh, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:11] good question for the audience to take a take home from that </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:02:14] super difficult question, Christian, actually. So the talk was around introducing. It was like knowledge sharing talk. there was very little actionable stuff. It was more about what's going on.</p><p>And I think the key point of the talk was that we don't can't afford to be complacent about this stuff. We of lift our hands and say, but I didn't know. We need to know this stuff. And I think that it's anybody working in digital at the moment, any developers as well, just need to be aware of what browsers are doing and the talk wasn't about browsers in general, it was about how browsers are implementing tracking prevention, tracking, blocking mechanisms.</p><p>Which are just super important stuff for people working, maybe testing and analytics and ad tech, especially we're feeling it. And we need to know what to do about it. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:58] Yeah. And Antonio, you run a digital agency that is impacted by this, or how are you impacted by this. How are your clients impacted by this?</p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:03:06] I think we are lucky. Luckily that's what have like big clients that spend money in taking steps faster than the browsers are doing. Yup. that also makes me, I feel sad because the smaller challengers, which I really kind afford this kind of solutions. So they're getting more behind.</p><p>So the. The big fish are getting bigger and the small fish are getting slower. Some of that's not something I really like about this whole game, but, so far we're not really impacted, within a B testing. It can be a nightmare. If we are with a client that's quite low on data. So the effect we need to create is quite big.</p><p>If we could lose like 60% or even if we lose 20% of the data, Then the number of wins will go down by 20%. So the business case is less strong, but in the end for me, it's making decisions based on data. So if you have less data, you've got to take some more risks, but still basing the decisions on that data is way better than, </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:04:00] yeah, exactly.</p><p>That's actually a super valuable. Point from time because it's easy to go on the conference stage and is just blast it. Everything's going to go to hell. We're going to lose our cookies, women and children first, and it's easy to paint the worst possible scenario. So we actually need people like Tony and we need people working in house to come and And dispassionately stay that by the way, we are seeing the impact, but it's not as big as some people say it is. So that's the key thing. Like we've been painting this future without third party cookie, and we've been extrapolating that to all possible different kinds of scenarios. And instead of doing that, we should actually empiric, we were working analytics.</p><p>We should have data to test what the impact is. So it's very easy to go. All neat jerky about it and say that everything's going to go to hell, but we can actually measure them. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:04:47] I wanted a presentation in a UX community in the UK. but the title, it's unethical not to experiment on your users.</p><p>Because their opinion was it's unethical to run experiments without those people knowing which is a good starting point. But if you don't run experiments, don't not using the data, then you're just going to implement something that's maybe even hurting the customer more. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:12] Yeah. And I had a discussion with, with parts of your colleague a couple of weeks ago, the first episodes of this year.</p><p>And we spoke about, the example was, that we have organization in the Netherlands doing all these kinds of campaigns. and they, I think a couple of years ago, or maybe last year, they did a campaign, next to the highways. I'm telling you not to use WhatsApp. But they didn't necessarily test it while many behavioral scientists might point out that.</p><p>Okay. Maybe in the first couple of seconds they will. Everyone agrees. Okay. Yeah. Maybe I shouldn't do that because that's a, that might be bad for me, but in the end, Literally at the end of the road, maybe more people might be hurts or worse. and they don't know. And so even if your intentions are good, you still should be validating if actually changes the behavior in the way you hope.</p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:06:06] I have to first ethical question. if your browser. Oh, the browser of the user is blocking your measurements, but you receiving an opt in. From the user that you're allowed to track that user. It's like the GDPR is in place. So yes, you can check my data. You can share it with everyone you want. I do actively opt in on this, but then the browser of the user is like preventing this is it as a cold and then work around the browser solution and come up with fingerprinting or some other solution to trick the user </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:06:39] anyway.</p><p>I don't know. it's it's different things. The user might not be consenting to a specific technology being in place. They might be consenting than if you do tracking, then go ahead and do it. But if the browser itself is denying the tracking from happening that the difficult is not just about an ethical question.</p><p>It's about an interpretation of intent. It's impossible for the site to know when the browser is blocking analytics. For example, it's impossible for you to know. It's this blocking happening intentionally by the user, regardless of GDPR, anything it's the user actually actively wanting to block GA or is it the baby being thrown with the bath water?</p><p>The user has just enabled some configuration default. Yeah. and the, I know that many people here and there are companies such as trace stock, for example, who are doing a really cool engineering feat, but they are earning on the side of, maybe the user didn't know maybe they do in tech that GA's okay.</p><p>And for me, I think that's part, the problem we're seeing right now, why browsers are doing this because browsers don't accept that browsers. These privacy engineers are earning on the side of absolute privacy by the user, regardless of what the underlying intent is. If the user is blocking, we have to earn on the side that they're doing that deliberately.</p><p>That's the kind of, and now the pool is going on between these two sides, are browsers absolutely correct. Or are. Vendors. Absolutely correct. And the truth is somewhere in between, but as long as we don't have a granular way of checking this. Then it's up to your own personal ethics. Do you earn on the side of respecting users without actually knowing what they are subscribing to?</p><p>Or are you willing to take the risk of doing this interpretation on the behalf of the user? Like maybe they just meant to block ads, but they accidentally blocked also GA that's the thought process. So </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:08:22] it's </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:08:23] very, absolutely impossible to say yes or no to an ethics question because it's always a granular.</p><p>Maybe it depends. Maybe not. That's like the scale. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:08:33] And then two weeks ago we were at super weak and Hungary on the mountain top. And then the Google tech management team announced five liters, the service that's fricking, and, you are finally able to tweet about this. And so you tweeted six suites and immediately the discussion became on, Oh my gosh, they're giving like this big gun, two people to kill everyone because now we can track every film.</p><p>Okay. Can you elaborate a bit on that and your take on that? </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:08:57] Yeah, just to tell the listeners, my point that I was saying is that moving tracking service side is problematic because. As long as it's in the browser, anybody can go to our website and audit the data trails. You can see them in the network requests.</p><p>You can do a objective audit. You can say that this website is, has all these trackers, but what happens if the website only sends a single stream of events into a local end point on the server end point.htan.com and you don't know what happens after that, because it's happened to the black box off the server.</p><p>it's, it gets into a very interesting discussion because this, what GTM is doing is not new. You feel you've had service side proxies for years and years and years. GTM of course, because being a Google tool will explode it will become like mainstream. So now we have to start looking into, is it okay that all this stuff happens in the black box of the server and what can we do about it?</p><p>What kind of tools? What kind of audits can we do? privacy advocates have no more tools left to tackle and will legal frameworks have to implement even stricter on even more specialized and specific stipulations in place, because that's the only thing that can be done after that. So browsers are obviously really interested in knowing what happens in the server, but the current attitude of things like ITP.</p><p>For example, is that as long as it's just the vendor doing horrible stuff with JavaScript, that's what ITP blocks. But as soon as the site takes responsibility by creating a service side endpoint or doing like a first party tracking, then it's not in safaris problem anymore. The site has deliberately decided to do this stuff.</p><p>So then it becomes a governance problem with the site owners and the vendors and the publishers. And they might have to ask her to the law </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:10:44] who knows it was one of the two top questions that were asked by the audience after your talk, which we were not able to go through. And one of the questions was what is the best solution I could implement now, at least less for some time.</p><p>And the second question was, if I'm going to invest money in service sites solutions, will this last for a longer time? Is it worth investing? </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:11:08] Yeah. right now, If you think about GA data and first party cookies, like a, what are AB testing tools you, the best solution right now is to rewrite them as HTTP cookies.</p><p>and even small businesses can do it. It's not an expensive solution. You can, if you're running CloudFlare, for example, you can do it with your edge cache. So basically what happens is that instead of writing cookies, the Java script, You send them to the server and the server responds back with an HTTP response that has the cookies.</p><p>And again, because your server is doing this Safari allows it to happen. The expiration is an impacted. Anybody can do that. I've written a solution myself. That's running on the Google cloud. There's an article about it, which is fairly inexpensive. But then the other question about the, investing in service side, it's totally possible to say, say what happens.</p><p>I would say that if things could continue on the current rate, then the service side is going to be good for many other reasons than just being able to circumvent privacy. we will be able to. Reduce a huge amount of stress from the client because the client no longer has to download all these really expensive, like JavaScript libraries.</p><p>All it has to do is send them shit too. Sorry to send this stuff to the server and the server will handle it. So it's just, it's not just about privacy, gays. It's all about performance gains, but. It's, it's not even a double edged sword. It has six or seven edges. Each one is sharpened poisoned, and we need to be careful </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:12:27] what's happening.</p><p>These are the most vendors that are being used a lot like Google, like Adobe or from AB testing perspective, like Optimizely VWO reputation. So on that they will come up with a solution that is indeed moving away from the browser and giving the. the opportunity, but also the responsibility in their hands, self dare users.</p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:12:45] So for AB testing, I really hope so. I've been flagging for service site testing for such a long time, because not only does it solve the problem of flicker and of calculating those complex bandits in the browser using pulling data from some endpoint. so it's a Supreme, the useful solution for AB testing in general with, or without the privacy implications.</p><p>And I think working in my mind about writing like a. Like a simple node library that would rewrite optimized to work Google optimize to work on the server. But I think there'll be faster than I am. So I'm waiting for them to do something, but it would make a lot of sense. Yeah. Like I think the one particular industry would benefit from moving to the service side is definitely, AB testing and personalization because they can just return.</p><p>The correct HTML with all the variations in place without having to calculate that stuff in the browser. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:13:31] Yeah. Personalization is of course DDPR personalization, AB testing, if it's just two split groups, but I'm the lawyer. So I fully agree that service sides. Yeah. Solutionist, </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:13:45] but the everything about GDPR, everything about CCPA, all the privacies of the world.</p><p>The thing is that moving just the service, it doesn't change the dynamic in any way. You still need informed consent. You still need opt in. It's not an excuse. The fact that it makes it a bit easier to do bad stuff is also not an excuse. So it's just a question of, I think that the risk is that many companies will jump.</p><p>At the chance to do this without considering you still need the exact same privacy safeguards in place, that would be if you do certain browser sidetracking. And I think that it's the responsibility of our industry, our events, our consultants, to make sure that people say understand what's happening.</p><p>The understanding is the problem that it's such a complex field, that it's very difficult to know who to follow, who to listen to. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:31] Yeah, I can imagine that for a lot of people then the responses. </p><p>let's wait and see. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:14:37] I'll also want to make sure I'm not bleeding here. Everyone should shift now to surface sites, a B testing.</p><p>I dunno, because you need to have development in place. If the server side testing your backend developers are releasing the code, it's a different ball game. So if you want to be fast than clients and testing has still is that Fountas. And before you make the decision, maybe boats. Yeah, it's the way to go now.</p><p>And then after a couple of months or years, we will see a flying site is still usable because it's so fast that's also something consider making a business decision. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:09] What would your response be to people saying, okay, let's just wait it out. maybe even I tried to explain this to my manager.</p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:15:16] Yeah, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:16] but he doesn't want me to put any time or money in it. And we don't want to be, the one, from all of our competitors the same as we do now. So why should we be one during this first </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:15:30] CME? Just go about as business as usual. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:32] Yeah. Yeah. I've heard of the losses. Same people. yeah, we don't see a lot of fines being handed out right now.</p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:15:40] Oh, you're talking about it. Oh, okay. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:42] Yeah. Yeah. But the same for the browser part that maybe managers don't necessarily understand that the impact that, I mean will only get worse. Yeah. Yeah. </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:15:52] that's a salient point to make. So about the legal stuff. I'm not going to comment. I honestly think that people should.</p><p>At least put it on the roadmap to be compliant like this it's just too risky. Otherwise, even for a small company, it's not just about the fines. It's about the brand damage. If some privacy watchdog out to you and the public that, Hey, this company is misusing your data, but about the browser stuff, like I'm like, I would definitely say to wait it out, unless you have the money to do like a proof of concept because.</p><p>This is the funny bit, which I also mentioned the presentation, I think is that we've had unreliable cookies for years and years and years. It's not like it's this it's a novel thing that our cookies are unreliable. ITP just happened to point the finger at them. And Hey, this is unreliable stuff.</p><p>Okay. Third party cookies are a different thing because they are definitely being undermined. and the business model is built on third party requests are definitely being undermined, but for our first party analytics, our GA cookies and our optimized cookies. They've been super unreliable for so long.</p><p>It could be no modes. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:16:53] The data quality. I think even this movement of browsers is only going to cost that everyone's going to use better. Yeah. Data, the data quality is really low, but now we have to worry about it. And then we have to come up with </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:17:05] the one, like the one thing that everybody should think about with their sites is logging in.</p><p>Like the log act action of logging in and authenticating against the server becomes so important because if you authenticate with the server, you no longer need any GA cookies or anything like that, you can always just fit some kind of authentication token from the server and use that instead. So you don't have to worry about your first party analytics surviving anymore.</p><p>So now the question comes. How do we incentivize login? If we don't already have it, will every single site in the world have this fake log-in where you enter the site and just click. Okay. And we'll log you in. And yeah. So it's </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:17:40] yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:41] I like websites like Amazon, where you're logged in forever.</p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:17:44] Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And when you login to one Amazon portal, you're logged into all of them. So that's like a walled garden building as well. So </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:17:51] yes, I'm sorry. At least cross defies also becomes less of a nightmare. </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:17:54] Yeah, exactly. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:17:55] True. I'm going to switch my place with Stino here because we only have four mics.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:01] No. Good. You can also sit here. Sounds fine. </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:18:05] But yeah, it's a, it's like giving advice is very difficult. So that's why I always try to, especially this presentation, it's so important for me to hedge it with saying that this is not to be construed as advice or recommendations. These are just findings and experimentation and people need to make up their own minds.</p><p>So our job as educators is to show what the facts are. And then let the people adjust those factors to their own organization. So the things that I mentioned there, if you would follow everything to the letter, you wouldn't be unable to do very much of anything with the website, because you'd be so scared about all the things that browsers are doing, but you take that information and you model it to whatever your organization is capable of.</p><p>Some of those things are really expensive. Service side tracking for a large company is not free. It's the scale of cloud computing. And those numbers is can cost thousands and thousands of dollars a month. and even for smaller companies, the barrier of entry is quite high, but, you just have to make the decision.</p><p>And some, for some companies it's going to be waiting it out. And that's fine. As long as you're aware of what the roadmap with the browsers is and what the roadmap with GDPR and CCPA and all these initiatives is, we just have to be aware of stuff. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:12] Yeah. you just mentioned, it's visually business as usual.</p><p>It doesn't change that much for us. but we have a new customer table. Steve welcome. Thank you. you're going to end this day, this conference with the talk at the end of analytics, </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:19:29] the end of analytics, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:30] as usual. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:19:31] Yeah. Yeah. That's a really good editor because it's essentially about Seymour was saying also, but don't mention it.</p><p>It's just new opportunities and the market is moving forward and indeed the end of analytics. Yeah. And we're going to have to make them make a new step into the new analytics. So looking forward to the top. </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:19:46] Exactly. so it's very much about these entire thing we have with Firebase and the entire protocol changing and our new approach to analytics.</p><p>So we have some infrastructure things in the browsers, but we also have a completely new way of thinking analytics and the way we work in. That is opening up a massive opportunity, but it's also a big reset for a lot of people. </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:20:06] it's completely new, but it's also quite old, like the event stream analytics, isn't, it's a hot tip back to the days before a user based on analytics and session stuff.</p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:20:15] yeah, but for a lot of the people here, it's like they, we, a lot of the analytics people are session based. Thinkers. So going back to innovating events based approach, it's a major change. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:20:26] And then they're afraid. So then the booking.com keynotes was talking about when she entered the company, Maria, they were shifting from the old analytics set up to the universal analytics up and Google analytics.</p><p>And everyone was like, Oh, this is a nightmare. We're going to lose all our data because it's the same with this step again. </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:20:44] But this is actually much worse because. From a traditional to universal was still the same. It's the same structure. You have data, right? This is a completely new data model and way of thinking because it's building on the app way of measuring things where it's not linear builder on pages.</p><p>So that gives massive challenge. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:21:04] And I like it because it's a raw data stream. You can measure everything and it makes so much more sense than to have this aggregate its thing on top of it. </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:21:12] But. But from my part, it also needs for everybody to if they want to use this, they have to step away from a vanilla approach and just implementing and actually start doing a data strategy in relation to their own business saying, what is it we need.</p><p>So I see that as really crucial because otherwise they're going to miss it and they're just going to try to recreate what they have next. say I used to have a car now. I got a helicopter, but I still just drive on the roads. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:40] So what's going to be, to take away from your talk right now. You don't have to worry about spoiling.</p><p>We have only had listeners at home, so they are nothing. Anyway. </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:21:48] So the main takeaway is that. Besides all the other problems we have a burning house with the browsers. we also have a burning car with the, with this entire tracking structure. We have some issues we need to attend and we need to attend it now.</p><p>so it's not a big problem because we have time in relations to the move to app and web, but it will become standard. And we might as well start preparing and start building a data set. So we will get. Some practice. So we will have some data. So we will start having the discussions of how we're supposed to do this.</p><p>So parallel tracking and setting that up and missing with the missing play with the app and web data to see where it takes her. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:22:26] Is that the big message from this year for another victory? Because we were all at super week, two weeks ago and Hungary and the organizers making this documentary and the questions he was asking too.</p><p>Probably you, are you also at least a question he was asking me in the footage documentary was, are we going to die? Is it the black future? All the dark questions. what's going on here. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:22:46] Yes. Yes we are. </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:22:49] But not until the end. I think in the meantime it is a big question, but so my approach is saying I've done analytics for 20 years now.</p><p>And for me, the world has ended in analytics a lot of time in those 20 years, </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:23:03] 27 times. Yes. </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:23:05] so this is just another way and another approach to adapting to change. but this change is actually really positive because if we use the things that are in app and web, and we'd go and think beyond just the tracking part, but also that the powers that are in Firebase in relations to activation, then suddenly.</p><p>This becomes about orchestrating the website. You can do AB testing, you can do targeted messaging. You can tie everything together. And it actually builds on a lot of other stuff. </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:23:35] I just want to get us out of the one thing I want to get us out of solutionism trap. So Atlas web for all the good it does.</p><p>And I do agree that it's a paradigm shift in how we do mobile analytics and as soon web analytics as well, I think, but it's still just a tool. And if the organization is crap and immature and unable to do basic analytics with GA Apolis web is not going to save them. It's just going to put them deeper in the quagmire.</p><p>So that's the one thing that's been constant throughout these years is that bad organizations do things badly and good organizations do things well, </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:24:07] it's got me a bit of super-big. There were many discussions on ethics, which are really good from the, I think there are many experienced practitioners at super weak ethical discussions, but if you take this discussion in your company, the company is not ready for that level of thinking on analytics.</p><p>They have to make more steps. Before they get to that level. And so indeed, if you get a Ferrari to a company that's not able to drive a normal car because they don't have to apply for license. then don't bring the Ferrari and their first friend them to </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:24:37] drive to Colway spring the Ferrari. If you have a Ferrari, are you kidding?</p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:24:43] I think you're right, but at the same time, I actually think that it's part of the process because the maturity of analytics in a place now that. We can do a lot of stuff with data and data can do a lot of harm if we are not careful. So the ethics disgust, that is something we need to have and actually ties strongly into the cookie things, because if we have an ethical we'll approach, so I'll tracking, I believe we will not be the companies who will be challenged by the limitations, because we will actually be having a behavior that is thinking.</p><p>Within the, </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:25:13] I fully agree that there's an opportunity to make a new setup for analytics house being used in the company. But I believe if you had a certain maturity level, if you're too low, then absolutely take the other steps. </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:25:24] Yeah. Yeah, I agree. But it is going to be required in. In a, not too distant future.</p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:25:30] Yeah. If you are booking or even another like ING, these are the type of discussions you could have and we think your whole, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:37] so you've all visited super weak and hungry </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:25:40] last week, two weeks ago. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:44] So what was it? Was it the main theme of the conference too, is it's a rather small conference, right?</p><p>Like 180 people on top of the mountain. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:25:51] That's what </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:25:51] I think it's more like five or 600 now. It's, there's a lot of people. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:25:54] I don't know. I only counted. I only counted that go into the room and in the room, I think max 200 people </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:26:00] throughout the whole week, people may go wait. </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:26:03] Okay. But it is five days of analytics.</p><p>so I guess it would be like 500 across five days. So you have like programs that start. a little late because there's no facility even program. so most of you will start around 10, but on some days the program ended around eight. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:26:20] Okay. </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:26:21] But that's like privacy and data are, they start definitely emerging, like all over the place.</p><p>And they used to be when GDPR came out. The topic was about GDPR specifically, but I think things are moving to a more generic position now, which is good. We're not talking about individual frameworks. We're talking about general attitude towards ethical data collection. And especially with all these data breaches, these incredibly huge data breaches, hundreds of millions of emails being.</p><p>Exploited, it's just become part and parcel of what we do. And this kind of thought process has shifted away. we can collect whatever we want to do, whatever we want with it to shifted naturally to maybe we should think about what we're doing. And I think that's a very healthy, </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:27:01] I've used that metaphor sometime when I've been talking to people about this saying.</p><p>We have had the privileges for some years of being like kids with keys to the candy store. And we'd been in the candy store and we just been eating candy and throwing it around and not really being careful what has been, what's supposed to be useful. so now somebody locked us out of the candy store and given us a budget.</p><p>So now we have to rethink what we're going to do with this data and how we can actually work it. I think. Yeah, that's a, yeah, an important thing because it limits us in relation to where we work. But we have also been, Oh, not us at the table, but we have seen people who have been data pics, gathering all they could in data, but not really doing it.</p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:27:43] Totally </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:27:43] me </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:27:44] just because I have to fill my data Lake, come on, it's an obligation. </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:27:50] It did a poem </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:27:51] or a data swamp. Yeah, no, absolutely. Yeah. Data lakes are all the rage. Let's just collect all that stuff and see what that one day we'll be able to use it. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:27:59] Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:27:59] but also saying it. So how would you advise the people that say, okay, th the bigger companies have the money to do this, but I'm a weapon list at a smaller company.</p><p>I cannot convince my management to put any money in this, or at least not right now. They're there. Approach is more like, okay, let the competitors figured it out first. </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:28:21] So I think part of this is with the combination of ethics and gathering data and excavation you actually in a place where the analyst becomes a business orchestrator or data orchestrator, making sure that you can actually do things.</p><p>So it's not now it's moving from a situation where we're just gathering the data. So we also activating it and that is probably one of. The major shifts that we see with us. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:45] Yeah. So we need to translate this into the benefits of the company instead of, </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:28:50] yeah. And so technically even the loan web analyst can now set something up that will, they will make the company money.</p><p>And that is changing the story of what the web analyst does. Yeah. So I tried to change the perception of being a web analyst to be a data driven business developer, because that is the value for the organization. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:12] Yeah. Okay. And, I think Don has to leave right about now </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:29:19] the rooms are starting in 10 minutes.</p><p>I do need a sense of waste before I act, when I host. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:24] You'll it'll get that. So my question will be, so are there any, developments in the market, do you expect to happen in 2020, either on software or legal or something that impacts our marker that you're either looking forward to or. </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:29:40] Did you </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:29:40] listen to what we were talking </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:29:41] about?</p><p>That's the only thing we'd be talking about. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:47] yeah. No, my mind, definitely. </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:29:50] Yeah. so I think just continuing this trend that we've been talking about, so data, more sophisticated data collection tools that are also taking, took out that the service side stuff likes with things with trace doc is doing, for example, I think there's going to be a proliferation of similar solutions.</p><p>So moving to this kind of quasi service side hybrid setups where the browser it's a client service stuff. I think we're going to see more of those at least in the, your future, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:13] because it's conditioned easier. </p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:30:15] Yeah. Make the transition. Yeah. Easier. It's just sold a very immediate problem, which is the browser is doing like blocking client side, but I'm not sure if, how long they're going to survive.</p><p>considering how fast browsers are moving, but also like we're going to see a lot of tools around auditing. Like auditing, same side cookies, auditing, third party cookies, creating reports, developer tools designed to help you go over your clients. I stayed mechanisms, crawlers that go through every page and check what cookies are being dropped.</p><p>I think we're going to see more of those. I think there's going to be a. Because we need that information to convince our managers. We need to show them that, Hey, okay, you don't have the money, but you still have the money to throw away to this advertiser who dashed and actually use it because we don't have any cookies left.</p><p>So I think that's </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:56] you say that the browsers are moving fast, but I think one of the most popular browsers Chrome is actually</p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:31:05] So one thing too, it's fun to make fun of Corona because they're the odd one out with tracking protections. But what they are doing is they are. Actively participating in these discussions. And the problem with Chrome is that because they are a market leader for them to do something, basically necessitated becoming a web standard.</p><p>So everything they do requires like a cross-browser consensus. So that's why it's moving so slowly. I'm not defending them. They could have done a lot of things already right now, but I do sympathize, especially with their privacy engineers. They might be, they might have. The will to make things happen, but they have like corporate responsibilities, business incentives.</p><p>And then there's the whole antitrust world where if Google suddenly blocked all third party cookies without an alternative, they would exclude all other ad tech and just enjoy their own little first party walled garden. So it's not, I do sympathize for Chrome, but I think they are actively trying to build things, the web standards way, which is just much slower, but it's also more better for us because all the browsers would agree.</p><p>At least the majority would how's it. </p><p>Steen Rasmussen: [00:32:08] I also think that we've got to see like also in parts of this, say Chrome is waiting because changes are coming up. I think we're going to see, it's going to be an intense tango of workarounds of somebody doing a work around and then the browser's doing an update and then somebody doing another workaround.</p><p>And so this moving back and forth. so the standard of tracking is really in flux right now. so for Google to go and do something that would push a major shift in relation to work. So right now they can let. Things consolidate and then hopefully move to standard. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:32:40] Yeah, that's true. And usually for the market leader, it's interesting.</p><p>Simo Ahava: [00:32:45] Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:32:45] To be moving first one. So </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:32:47] exactly. Let's not go into the advertising income, Hotspur income, sorry, discussion. That's a whole different topic. But for this year, I think, having a center of excellence on analytics, which was one of the topics all sorts of a week, that's a big opportunity for that because, the data quality being able to measure data track.</p><p>Yeah, everything is going to be harder and harder. So if you have a center of excellence, democratizing analytics and quality assurance on analytics, that's an interesting move. I think, because in the end you want to have more business units or product teams or marketing use that data. So it must be easy for them to use the data and the data quality should be good.</p><p>We're not the experts in collecting data, which is getting harder and harder. So I think the center of excellence perspective is an interesting one for the bigger companies. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:33:31] Yeah. Exactly. almost Lang she will have a salesperson. Thank you so much. Have a great conference. </p><p>Ton Wesseling: [00:33:37] Thank you very much.</p><p>‍</p>",true,4bd8f368

Along with data warehousing, streaming and discovery tools. We're talking about a why they build their own experimentation tool. We talk about how they are managing their internal experimentation culture and how to run offline experiments in case you missed it.</p><p>In the previous episodes, we spoke with Tim Ash about his new book unleash your primal brain. You can listen to the episode on the Ciroc fate website or in the podcast app you're listening with right now. Welcome to season three, episode two.</p><p>Chad: [00:01:03] Right now I'm working at a company called convoy. They're a digital freight brokerage. I can talk a little bit more about them later, but as for me I'm running their data platform team. So the data platform. Is a sort of a multi-disciplinary data related. Pod space, which includes like our data warehouse, all of our data, infrastructure, tooling, data, visualization, our machine learning platform.</p><p>And then also our experimentation team, which we've not only built a center of excellence there, but we've also built a tool from the ground up before this, I was at Microsoft where I helped run their experimentation platform. Along with Ronnie, Kohavi sort of the grandfather of AB testing. And then part of that, I was at Sephora in some way, doing very similar things.</p><p>Guido: [00:01:50] Yeah. And you're now at a convoy for roughly one year, about a year. And what was the status of CRO at convoy before you started? Yeah, </p><p>Chad: [00:01:59] they cobbly was very they love testing. In fact, part of our. WBR which our weekly business review, where all the leadership sits down and looks at key metrics and how they're performing.</p><p>Most of those actually have to be validated by an AB test. So experimentation is a pretty deep part of the culture. I think some of the other aspects of CRO that you and I are familiar with, haven't gotten quite as deep yet, especially on the marketing side, but on the product side there, they're doing a pretty good job.</p><p>Guido: [00:02:31] Okay, nice. And one of the topics that we want to talk about and touch upon today is building your own experimentation platform. So was it already done when you started that? </p><p>Chad: [00:02:44] We had a pretty rough tool. It did a few things relatively well. It did a few things very poorly.</p><p>So over the last year, we've put a lot of time and effort and energy into actually making it serviceable to most of our customers. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:03:00] So many people might now be wondering why there's so many options on the market. Why would you build your own your own AB testing platform? </p><p>Chad: [00:03:09] Yeah. Yeah, that's a good question.</p><p>It's also, usually the first one. I always get, bring up that we built something. The main reason is that when we were essentially deciding what direction we wanted to take the team, all of convoy as a whole. We sat down and we thought about the problems that we have specific to our business and what our problems were probably going to be in the future, and then looked at the market of AB testing tools and says do any of these actually satisfied those problems to a degree that we would feel comfortable with and happy with?</p><p>And our answer to that question was no. And there were a few specific very specific problems that we absolutely needed. Solved. So for example we needed the ability to tie all of our experiment back to metrics like margin and profit, and sometimes very algorithmically complex metrics that are all calculated offline.</p><p>And at the time, the tools that we saw couldn't support that we also needed a lot more complex statistical test designs than a T tests. We Cabo has a super small business. We only have around 50,000 customers or truckers that we work with and a much smaller number of shippers around a hundred or maybe even less.</p><p>So if you don't have a huge sample size, then your test design has to be relatively complex. It has to do a lot of interesting things and we needed a tool that could support a pretty wide degree of complexity. And we just didn't see that out there. </p><p>Guido: [00:04:44] Yeah. So in that sense, it's more like a B2B, a smaller business case that might be then it might be helpful to build your own tool, but then again you still need to have the luxury of being able to build it.</p><p>So do you have developers in house? Is it something you outsource? How are the, </p><p>Chad: [00:05:00] yeah, we have developers in house. So there are four right now. There are four engineers. That working on the experimentation platform, I think for the first year or so, there was two, I didn't join as a product last year. So now we have four engineers is one engineering manager that sort of manages everybody across all of data platform.</p><p>And then myself to help out with vision and direction. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:05:28] And I almost hear our listeners through the channels screaming, but how did you build a business case for this? Some people already did this. Hiring for people to build your experimentation platform. That sounds way more expensive than than just using a random AB testing tool.</p><p>Maybe even the most expensive one. Yeah. Yeah. </p><p>Chad: [00:05:51] That's a good point. I think it probably is. I think so, like I mentioned when we did our cost benefit analysis. The question that we asked is if we paid and I don't know off the top of my head, how much &nbsp;AB testing third-party AB testing tools cost these days, but we'll just throw out a number and say like $300, $300,000.</p><p>Okay. $300,000. That's basically at startup costs, like maybe one and a half developers maybe even make the case for one, if it's a pretty senior developer. If we go with a tool that doesn't allow us to do the things that we functionally needed to do, where are we going to lose experimentation?</p><p>Like where are we not going to be able to do tasks? We're actually not going to be able to do tasks on the vast majority of our machine learning models. And machine learning is the essence of Conway. And take a step back to explain what convoy is, because this may make more sense.</p><p>Commonly is a digital freight brokerage. And that means that when a shipper has freight, do they want to move between two points on a map? Usually they don't go directly to the trucker. That's going to be carrying that freight. There's just so many things that could go wrong. The carrier might have a family emergency, and then all of a sudden you have this critical load.</p><p>That's just sitting there and now there's no backup. So a broker sits in between the shipper and the trucker. And as free comes in, they're the ones responsible for making sure it's paired up with the right most economic person to take that load. Convoy has entered the space and said, we want to try to do as much of that matching as we can with data science and with machine learning and algorithms.</p><p>So ML is literally the core of the business. And if we weren't able to run experiments on ML and the way that we wanted the, why you didn't get a testing tool, right? Like we could take the money to optimize our app a little bit, but the impact that we see from doing that, just to throw out a relative number.</p><p>We might see a couple hundred thousand dollars in improvement from UX changes. We might see several hundred million dollars in improvement from changing our experimenting on our algorithms. So that was what was the trade off. We have to make if paying the money for the developer allows us to do experimentation on this hugely critical functionality, it was actually more than justified.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:08:12] Yeah. So in that sense, it sounds like a relatively easy business case. The existing platforms don't even do what you want them to do and don't apply to your business. But was it the completely complete starts from scratch or were there some things in the machine learning community and that there's a community out there that you could use or reuse anything open source?</p><p>Chad: [00:08:34] We didn't open source anything. There's a few things, there are some things that are open source that you could reuse if you want to take a less expensive route than we did. &nbsp;At least there's some stuff now. I don't know if back then when the platform first started, which was actually a couple years ago that there was anything of any good out there, really the most complicated piece from an engineering perspective that we needed to think about was assignments.</p><p>And that's the process of when a randomization entity, it could be a user in our case, we like to randomize on shipments and lanes, which is like from Seattle and San Francisco, essentially a distance between two points. Whenever that unit, that new entities available to have a test run on it, you have to randomize them.</p><p>And that seems like something that you could do relatively easily by flipping a coin. But it's actually not that easy. There's a lot that you have to think about when it comes to scale. If you get, a million requests to randomize in the span of a second, which can happen if you're, if there's like a bug or something like that, you don't want the whole business to fall down.</p><p>If you're dialing traffic up and down, you don't want people to get re randomized every single time. So that was an early investment that we had to make. That didn't really have an open source solution. Yeah, that was probably the biggest one. </p><p>Guido: [00:09:50] Yeah. Were there are big changes this year and all of those algorithms that change based on all the things happening in our world.</p><p>Chad: [00:09:58] Yeah, there were right. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. The freight market in general is super volatile and it's very sensitive to, especially sensitive to things like COVID, but even seasonality, we see freight the margin that we're making on any particular shipment will. Really fluctuate wildly throughout the year.</p><p>So when COVID hit, we saw some of the biggest swings that we've ever seen. And we had to really think about how we could tune our models more for stability. So during that time, experimentation was actually super. </p><p>Guido: [00:10:31] Yeah, I can imagine. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. And how do you get everyone in the company?</p><p>I can imagine this is quite Quite a complex matters that you're trying to optimize for it's machine learning. On top of that, there's a lot of experimentation. How do you get the company? How do you get buy-in from everyone in the company to, to embrace </p><p>Chad: [00:10:50] this to embrace experimentation just in general?</p><p>Yeah. Yeah. The way that I've found a lot of successes by focusing on measurement and by asking the question. If you're making some change, whatever that changes, it could be a web change. It could be a change is happening offline. It could be a change to a model, could be a strategy process change.</p><p>How do you actually know that the thing that you did work? Like how do you know </p><p>Guido: [00:11:16] for sure. So basically you asking questions to make people insecure. Yeah. </p><p>Chad: [00:11:25] Make them insecure. But also oftentimes most people who run these teams are very smart, right? Like they know what they're doing. They know that they probably can't measure it very well.</p><p>And when you, when the perspective that you come at them with is. Experimentation is a solution to a measurement problem that you have. And because what their job is to do is to make the company a whole bunch of money, prove it, and then increase their head count. If I can go to you and say, I can help you prove it, meaning I can help your team get funded better.</p><p>Then that's a much easier way to get adopted than here's 10 test ideas that you can run that I think might make you money, but you have to give me resources for that. </p><p>Guido: [00:12:06] Yeah. And in that sense, do you feel like that's a culture of innovation and a culture of experimentation? Is that </p><p>Chad: [00:12:12] similar or culture of innovation and experimentation are very similar?</p><p>I think it's slightly different. I think that a culture of experimentation is almost like saying a culture of science, meaning when we are making a claim about the world, Can we point to some evidence, usually statistical evidence that backs up our claims evidence, a culture of innovation. Isn't quite the same as apt, but it's closer to, are we consistently taking risks?</p><p>Are we taking chances? Are we doing things that, otherwise people in our position would be scared to do. And then, or can we combine the two to then measure those risk-taking opportunities with statistics? </p><p>Guido: [00:12:59] Okay. And this is also something that's that your platform tries to enable within the company or pure, purely for any experiment that none has done or, </p><p>Chad: [00:13:09] For our platform, we focus pretty much on &nbsp;that's not exactly true.</p><p>So we do focus pretty strongly on experimentation, but our platform is, was designed to be super flexible. So the idea is. Any type of statistical model you want to use, you can use it, any kind of metric you want to use. You can do that and you can do it all, basically for the most part out of the box.</p><p>Any type of dimension you have, you can do that. And so you can slice it by anything. So the practical effect of that, that we've seen is that people will use the tool to do some really crazy stuff and to test. I'll say innovative things that most people using a third party platform maybe wouldn't test.</p><p>So as an example we have this concept of combo of pilots. Where a pilot is just something that you just do, you turn it on and then you have to have some way of monitoring it over time. &nbsp;You're on the ops team, for example. And you're trying to build something that maybe makes the op team slightly more efficient, or maybe automate some of the emails that they get.</p><p>That's not really something that you can AB test. You don't want 50% of your ops team to have to open emails and they have a standard operating procedure and it doesn't match what the rest of the ops team. So they just turn it on. And what we've been seeing is this move to using an experimentation platform to start measuring these types of changes as well.</p><p>Guido: [00:15:03] What kind of KPIs are you guys optimizing for? So if you have all these different teams doing the experimentation, are they optimizing for the same thing ultimately, </p><p>Chad: [00:15:12] or. No most teams are most teams. You have a specific set of metrics that they're accountable to every half year. This is like the, OKR type of approach.</p><p> Yeah. We do have what we call core metrics. So these are things that the entire business really cares about and we haven't implemented this yet, but what we're trying to move to is. Any of those core metrics that can be run on an experiment. So like variable cost per shipment is something that we like to think about.</p><p>Are we reducing or increasing the amount of variable costs every time, a new shipments or comes in on our platform? That's a really important metric to the company. And if somebody is running a shipment level experiment, then what our platform do is automatically track that metric whether or not the team actually wanted to include it.</p><p>Guido: [00:16:02] Sure. And then they big the statistical model themselves. You're saying. And of course, it's nice to have that a that's great to have that flexibility, but it also puts a lot of responsibility in the person designing the experiments. Of course. So how do you make sure that people yeah they pick the rights statistical model.</p><p>Chad: [00:16:20] That's a good question. For the most part at convoy, our experiments are designed by data scientists. So these are generally not people who are like encountering experimentation for the very first time. They usually have a pretty good concept of this is this statistical technique that I want to use.</p><p>That makes the most sense for my use case. And we're just giving them a forum to select that. Now I do think something that we should probably do as the future goes on because we do want to make experimentation more accessible to everybody. Is probably how a set of predefined templates say, okay, if you want to do an offline experiment and here's some criteria that you have to meet, then you just run this one.</p><p>If you want to do an online experiment, and it's a relatively simple AB tests on the internet, then you can just use a T test and we bundle all that stuff. </p><p>Guido: [00:17:15] Yeah. &nbsp;Already applying some machine learning techniques on the. Experimentation platform itself to help the experimenters, right?</p><p>Chad: [00:17:24] We're not, but that is probably gonna be our some of our goals for the platform in 2021. And. Really that's that's less about being smart right now. Like being really smart about which test wins and which loses in these types of things and more about, can we automate some of the work that our analysts and data scientists are doing and allow a machine to take over.</p><p>In places where a human being, doing all this digging and segmentation to find interesting things is pretty unreal. </p><p>Guido: [00:17:58] Yeah. And that's a, a lot of data scientists and a lot of web analysts are. Often, sadly used to create reports, right? That's not something you should you should be doing actually, you should automate all those things.</p><p>And then when automation goes wrong, sure. You step in, but it's not something that's a data scientist should be. Yeah. It's </p><p>Chad: [00:18:20] a waste of time, right? Like they're the data science best resources, their brain. And it's the critical thinking part that's important and valuable. It's not like the, doing the same thing over and over again, managing the data, putting it into the right format, finding out leaders like a machine can do all of that stuff.</p><p>Guido: [00:18:38] Yeah. Don't waste that brain on creating PowerPoints. </p><p>Chad: [00:18:42] Exactly. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:18:43] When are you going to spin off the product and creating your own AB testing company? Probably </p><p>Chad: [00:18:50] never.</p><p>Honestly, there are some great tools out there. I would not in the, anybody in the AB testing space. I think you saw Optimizely got acquired. How long ago? Pretty recently, like a couple of weeks ago now, </p><p>Guido: [00:19:08] a couple of weeks ago. </p><p>Chad: [00:19:10] Yeah. Optimize. It got acquired and they were the golden boys of this space.</p><p>And yeah, I don't know. I just wouldn't want to there's a lot of competitors that do a lot of really interesting things. I don't know if I would be interested in going head-to-head with any of them, </p><p>Guido: [00:19:27] but it does sound like there's a big gap in the market, right? For for B2B companies that are open to experimentation and open to learning.</p><p>But don't have the traffic on their website maybe to do it. But Gail Talk to those companies, what are the things that you can experiment? How can you be creative in that maybe you don't have enough traffic on your website, but one of the things that you can experimental. Yeah. </p><p>Chad: [00:19:51] I'm sure you know this, but there's a inverse correlation with the amount of traffic you have and the size of the impacts that you need to see before you can detect something.</p><p>Conway has that same problem and there's really no. Statistical algorithm that can never sort of change that fundamental issue. So that plays a really big effect on how we do experimentation. Instead of looking at things like let's optimize a UX flow, let's change a button color here or there, or maybe try changing some copy.</p><p>The only things that we look at are big changes, which kind of flies in the face of typical advice, make an incremental change. And then you'll be able to prove that this is the real thing. And this is what caused the change. And then you can increment from there. I actually think that for a lot of companies, that's a really bad way of testing.</p><p>Because incrementality is not going to deliver very many business results. &nbsp;Instead. Really taking a long time to think about your customer, thinking about what are the major new features and offerings that we can provide doing some deep user research. And pre-testing on that. And then having a really strong opinion on, I believe that this thing is going to be a giant improvement for the company and then using experimentation as a validation tool for all of that research, you've done.</p><p>That's the process I would suggest to a B2B. The last thing I'll say about that is I would, a lot of people actually don't know, is it a lot of these techniques, take this sort of incremental approach to experimentation. It started at massive companies like Google and Microsoft.</p><p>So for them it makes sense, right? Like when you have billions and billions of users that are coming to your site every day, the amount of change that the amount of impact that you can detect is Extremely small and you can detect it in a couple of days. So it actually makes total sense for them to make those incremental changes because they can see them all and they can see them really clearly.</p><p>But for everybody else, it's insane advice. I think. </p><p>Guido: [00:21:54] Yeah, exactly. And I think for all the dogs that I have with people in Shiro, the most creative things come from people that don't have that amount of traffic. The amount of traffic if you have a lot of traffic, it basically makes you lazy.</p><p>Yeah. Dampers your your creativity is not great for your innovation. And and usually and it does bigger things are also, for me, at least they're more fun to work on. </p><p>Chad: [00:22:20] Yeah, I agree. All we've seen some really cool stuff in combo where like I'm constantly amazed at some of the tests that are coming out.</p><p>One that I thought was really cool. Is we have a process called an RFP that we go through with our partners, our shipper partners, where we essentially bid on the on the shipments that they have available. And we have a, we had a team that started doing experimentation on those bids.</p><p>So when they would come in from a big shipper, we would randomize the response that we gave. So we would have some prediction of this is what we think this particular shipment is going to call. When we put it on the market, we would supply a premium to some of them, a discount to some limit in an Uber premium to some of them and send those back and then, and do an experiment there.</p><p>And that was awesome. And actually like extremely impactful. And it's just a creative thing that you have to do exactly. As you said, when you don't have a lot of budget to build some like amazing really complex system. </p><p>Guido: [00:23:18] Yeah, exactly. Do you guys also do a I'll find testing? </p><p>Chad: [00:23:21] We do. Yeah, we </p><p>Guido: [00:23:22] do. So do you have some examples?</p><p>Chad: [00:23:26] Yeah, pretty much all of our examples from, so we've, we actually have a, an internal tool that we call kingpin. And kingpin is essentially an ops. It's a platform for the operations team, so that they can see, winner details about all the shipments and when they're arriving and when the orders are going out and whether they're on time or not, and things like that.</p><p>And one of the issues there is that the team is who manages those tools are constantly trying to make improvements to them so that they can make our operations team more efficient. But like I mentioned before, if you make a change to that to that platform, then you need to actually make it for the entire operations team because ops team members, not only do they communicate with each other really closely, but you'll need to know.</p><p>For example, if somebody took a particular action on a shipment and then it went back into the system and then it came back and now an ops personnel has to take another action. You definitely don't want to run an experiment where some things are visible and other things are invisible. It'll just confuse ops people.</p><p>If the SLPs &nbsp;are pretty significantly different and you're sitting right next to somebody, you're looking at a screen and you need help with something and you look over and their screen is something different because they're getting a different version of that. So these are the types of offline experiments where we really have to think more like a lawmaker.</p><p> Lawmakers running experiments on laws is actually quite common where somebody will say we have created a law and we are going to ship it in one part of the country for a certain period of time. See what the effect is, and then roll it out everywhere else. That is an experiment. And that is a type of experimentation that we try to do relatively frequently.</p><p>Guido: [00:25:11] Now w what are the main differences when you went on to set up an offline still digital, but offline experiment, not the web experiments for, as a WebEx? </p><p>Chad: [00:25:20] I would say that the big differences are typically you can't control your you can't control your randomization as much, right? When you're online, you have a very tight control over which user gets to see which thing.</p><p>And in the real world that may not always be the case. So you have to come up with creative ways to bucket your control and treatment. The example I gave a second ago, what we did was we put everybody before the time that we launched the experiment into the control. And everybody, after we launched the experiment into the treatment, and then we use the time that the feature launched as the dividing line between those two things.</p><p>And then we had our two buckets and we could actually compare. And there's some other mechanisms that you could use to take away bias and this type of stuff, but like just that level of thinking is really important. And there actually are times when you can do randomization offline. So when I used to work at subway we would very frequently roll out new sandwiches and new features to a trial population.</p><p>And you just have to be specific and very careful about which stores you roll out to. Often, because subway is a franchisee restaurant. Like you have, it's franchisee owned. There's no, no sort of ownership on the subway side. So that means in order to, to trial a new sandwich, you have to opt in.</p><p>And the people who are opting in are obviously not necessarily the same stores as the one we're not opting in. So those are the types of things that you have to think about when you're experimenting offline. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:26:54] Interesting. Yeah. So is there if you do that and do you also do experiments that are not even digital or do you like it.</p><p>Chad: [00:27:05] We haven't done too many of those at convoy. That is something I'm very familiar with. I think there's a lot of there's a lot of the, they're not e-commerce but just regular commerce, yes, </p><p>Guido: [00:27:17] it does exist. </p><p>Chad: [00:27:18] Those still exist, but in anyone, in any place where you have an offline store, so that was definitely the case with Sephora.</p><p>And it was also the case with subway. There was a pretty good amount of totally offline experimentation, where we had almost no insight from the digital perspective, what was going on. And at somebody in particular, they experimented on everything. They would experiment on like opening times and closing times and staffing and how they arrange the actual ingredients to build the sandwich and things that they try to shorten the lines or potentially make the lines longer.</p><p>All types of stuff like that they ran experiments and really running the experiment is relatively trivial. If you're able to get your randomization, so if you're able to figure out that, how do we bucket control and treatment in a way that's trustworthy? There's a ton of stuff that you can do after that.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:28:13] And for all these experiments and also at the offline and online where do you guys get your, basically your inspiration? And that sounds a bit random, but where do the ideas for these experiments come from? Do you do a lot of user research or those surveys, or I can imagine that's also a bit harder to do when you don't have the number.</p><p>Chad: [00:28:32] Yeah. It's. It's yeah, it can be a more, certainly more challenging. I think the good thing about these types of offline experiments is that your customers are definitely a little bit more approachable in the sense of you have some insights into their day-to-day activities that perhaps extend beyond the web.</p><p>The challenge in digital is I have no idea who that person is that just bought something. </p><p>Guido: [00:29:03] Any anyone I didn't beat to be by definition, you have a business relationship. You basically know who you are. </p><p>Chad: [00:29:09] Yeah. You know who your audience is. Hopefully if you've built up a pretty good rapport with them, then you can, it's easily easy to reach out to them and talk to them.</p><p>And they're friendly. </p><p>Guido: [00:29:19] Hopefully. But that's so that's basically the main way you guys get to get input for experiments or, </p><p>Chad: [00:29:26] yeah I think user research and a lot of direct talking to customers is a lot of where that comes from. I think there are certainly places that are more analytical.</p><p>So for example, something that I know the operations team thinks about relatively frequently is emails. And when you're in ops, you have to respond to a lot of emails coming in from shippers emails coming in from chuckers. And if you build instrumentation into your platform or you're using a third party service that is able to collect, and track all these emails for you, then you can see where people are spending their time.</p><p>And if you have some type of categorization mechanism, You can see the specific type of emails that they spend a long time replying back to. And when are they getting replied back to, and what's the Delta between when the email is received and when it's responded to, right? Like you have all this data, and that's another sort of inspiration point, obviously not just emails, but any other place where you're able to capture sort of the behavior of whatever your customer is.</p><p>That's another place that we've seen experiment inspiration come from.</p><p>Guido: [00:31:03] And now looking back, you've worked for convoy for a year and what's your second VR going to be? Like, what are you going to focus on? Yeah. </p><p>Chad: [00:31:10] So our first year, my first year at convoy was really about. Making the entire experimentation funnel, I guess you could call it of really simple, really usable, really straightforward.</p><p>So when I was there, it was possible to deploy an experiment, but analysis was pretty challenging. We didn't really have this bring your own algorithm component. That's something new that we added. We didn't have the ability to automate a workflow, which is another really big thing. That's basically being able to say, I want to do something really interesting.</p><p>So maybe I want to start my experiment at 1% traffic. I want to create bunch of monitors that check whether or not some metrics are failing. And then if the answer is, if everything looks good, then I want to roll that up to 500, check the monitors again, then roll it up to 50% and start computing a totally different set of metrics.</p><p>Maybe for the first few days, I only want to look at those super short-term metrics that are really good indicators of whether or not it's experiment, failing. And then after that, I want to start looking at more longer term metrics. And there, there is a cost component there. A lot of people don't see that because that's abstracted away by the AB testing company.</p><p>But when you're doing these large scale computations of data, that really in essence, that's what you're paying for. &nbsp;You're paying for all of these joins across, hundreds of thousands or hundreds of millions of data points. So there, there is a cost component there that we try to affect positively.</p><p>So that was 20, 20 and 2021 is more about analysis. So we've solved most of that problem. And now it's going to be, how do we get data scientists out of the business of spending so much time doing debugging and like doing this type of segment discovery. So what segment actually performed well and what didn't and trying to automate as much of that as we can.</p><p>Guido: [00:33:03] What do you think you spend in a year? </p><p>Chad: [00:33:06] Yeah, I think we're in a pretty good place. I think into the year I think most of the big analytical insight automation work is done. And I think the next big challenge is how do we start meaningfully reducing the time that it takes to run experiments.</p><p>That's going to be my big sort of post 2021 goal is with small sample sizes. How can we cut the runtime before you can make a decision by 50%? </p><p>Guido: [00:33:37] Okay. Are there on there KPIs that you look for the experimentation program itself? </p><p>Chad: [00:33:42] We look at a few things. The big goal for us right now is templatization.</p><p>So how many experiments get run that are templatized? And at one point we did have like pure numbers of experiments. It's still something that we track and we report on, but it's not our key goal anymore. And the reason we're focusing on templatization is we can say that when someone runs an experiment, that was essentially prebuilt, they're just changing the content.</p><p>There's a lot of time savings happening. I think the scientist doesn't have to select the metrics. They don't have to choose the algorithm. They don't have to set the sample size or do the workflow. So there's like several hours to more than a day of savings there. And we're just adding all that up.</p><p>It's like a productivity enhancement for the business. </p><p>Guido: [00:34:27] Okay, but then almost by definition, those are not the most creative experiments, right? Because there's a template templates for them or, </p><p>Chad: [00:34:34] Oh no. Th so the template really only applies to the design, but the actual experiment itself is usually pretty open so they can experiment on anything.</p><p>But you may want to say, for example yeah, I'm doing some crazy new change, but there's actually a pattern for testing that type of crazy change. And I just want to use that like measurement pattern and that algorithmic pattern. </p><p>Guido: [00:34:57] Okay. Fair enough. And you've been to podcasts before you've been to a CRO events before sat on panels before.</p><p>Maybe you've touched on that in the past hour already, but what do you think. The insights. What are the insights that you have based on what you've done with a zero before that you don't see a lot of other zero zeros have, </p><p>Chad: [00:35:20] Oh yeah. Good question. So I think, okay, so there's a couple of answers here.</p><p>One thing, and probably I contributed to this, honestly, but I think that people get too worked up about the statistics. I think they care too way too much. &nbsp;When you were running an experiment, the real question that you should ask from &nbsp;what statistics do I use perspective? Shouldn't be like, which one performs the best in simulations or whatever it is.</p><p>That's fine. But the question is would a different algorithm have resulted in a different, a practically different result? And if the answer is no, and the vast majority of cases, it is no, that it doesn't matter. Who cares? It's a waste of time to think about that's one thing.</p><p>Another thing I think I already talked about this incrementality thing that I really disliked before, but I think using Oh, I got one. I have a good one, actually. So this is something we haven't really talked about yet. The a big, I think something that CRS do, which is not great is use the results of an experiment as a forecast for the future is that's to say, this experiment made $50,000 over the course of the test and I ran it in two weeks.</p><p>And so if I continue to run it for an additional full 50 weeks at a hundred percent, then I should make, 10 million or whatever the number is. That's not right. And the reason it's not right is because a statistical the outcome of a statistical test, the P value is not predictive. It's actually backwards looking right.</p><p>It's showing you, this is what happened at some point in the past. It doesn't say anything about what's going to happen next month or the month after that or six </p><p>Guido: [00:37:14] months after that? I think, or maybe hope that a lot of shit, especially as do know this, but they are forced almost by managers or of their team or company or whatever to do predictions to say.</p><p>Okay. What is the value that you've added as a CRO, especially as the Orsiro team. Yeah, exactly. So &nbsp;what are better ways for them to do this? Yeah, </p><p>Chad: [00:37:38] I think there's too, there's sort of two philosophical perspectives that you could take, right? You could take the perspective of &nbsp;as a experimentation team or as a CRO team.</p><p>It's actually not our job to add a whole bunch of money bottom line to the business. That's like not what we're here for. You could say is what my real job is to go and think about really interesting things that we could be investing in new products, new features, new, whatever it is and validate those offline.</p><p>So validate those with our customers and validate those through user testing. And then experimentation just becomes a mechanism like a guard, like a, basically a guard rail to say, is anything going wrong here? So that's one way that you could use experimentation. That's a hundred percent valid and I've actually seen quite a few businesses that are starting to think about AB testing in this way, when they don't have predictive capabilities and the way as a team that you justify that, as you say listen, we actually caught.</p><p>20 out of 30 things that were bad. And we know that this would have harmed the business in some meaningful way because we caught them in a parallel universe where we didn't have AB testing, we would have deployed them. So that means that you could say, we know for a fact that this thing would have heard us by $10,000 or $20,000 or whatever it is.</p><p>And we don't know exactly what the pain would have been over a long period of time, but we know that it probably wouldn't have been 10 or $20,000. So we're actually saving the company money. And the more experiments that we do, the more money that we, we can say that's one perspective you could take.</p><p>The other thing that you could do, if you really want to show ROI is invest in a forecast. And invest in a forecasting predictive metric. This is actually something that we've done at convoy as well. And essentially what you do, and this does require some data science slash analyst effort. So it's not cheap and it's not necessarily certainly not free, but it could be cheap, I guess it depends on who's on staff.</p><p>But essentially what you do is you can build some type of predictive model that takes in a set of short-term KPIs. And it looks at your data and looks at how those short-term KPIs influence longer-term KPIs. And you could say based on how the market is fluctuating and based on the performance of our tests over long periods and based on how these metrics typically move together, we think that this experiment is going to deliver a 3% revenue uplift over six months.</p><p>And then you'll still, you're still going to be wrong, but at least you're going to probably be a lot less wrong than if you're just using a P value as a forecast. </p><p>Guido: [00:40:21] Yeah. That's great insight, I think. Thanks. So of a final thing I wanted to talk to you about experiments, not expert.</p><p>Yes. Yes. That's the website. Yeah. </p><p>Chad: [00:40:34] What is it? So this is new a few months ago I realized that I have talked to a lot of people in the space about experimentation and there's I think in general, a lot of these problems around AB testing are a lot more complex than sometimes people can think.</p><p>And learning about them from a high level is great. But when you actually go to implement, there's a lot of problems that stuff breaks. It doesn't work the way that we expect we make there's there's I think Luke w from Google made a post this is a while ago, maybe over a year ago where.</p><p>He was taking the stuff out of AB testing. He said, these are the results that CRS say AB testing has delivered, but here's the actual sort of business trend. And they're in like diverging directions, &nbsp;and those those are the types of things that happen.</p><p>Cause there's just a lot more complexity that the people realize. So I started thinking. Since I've been in this complex space for awhile and I've solved a lot of those challenges. It would be cool to provide some of that information back and to work with teams and potentially individuals and consultancies on like really going deep theoretically and scientifically.</p><p>So that's what that website is about. </p><p>Guido: [00:41:49] So people can hire you as a, as like a mentor or are you actually working with them? </p><p>Chad: [00:41:55] I probably don't have the time to do the actual work. I wish that will be really fun, but yeah, as a mentor or working through particular use cases or problems, whether it's like culture related or science related anything experimentation related is stuff that I love and would be willing to, and always able to talk about.</p><p>Guido: [00:42:14] Awesome. So if people are interested in that, the link is in the show notes of this episode. Yeah, my final question then who should I invite for an upcoming CRO CAFE episode, who is something who has something to tell about a topic that you think that's really interesting. </p><p>Chad: [00:42:29] Yeah. So I definitely think Jeff Ferris, if you want another person from convoy, Jeffers would be somebody great to have.</p><p>Jeff is a economist. He formerly was at Amazon and he was working with the experimentation team at Amazon for a really long time and his specialties and this type of a long-term prediction and making predictions about the world and also an experiment. So there's some really cool stuff that he's done in the past.</p><p>Another person that I think would be really interesting to talk to. I don't know if you've had Jonas on Jonas man, his last name escapes me, but he's building an AB testing tool himself formally at booking. And we have a bit of a different approach to the AB testing sort of thought process and mentor Jonah's album.</p><p>Sorry, Jonas but super smart guy. Great to talk to knows a lot about experimentation, AB testing and just a wellspring of knowledge. </p><p>Guido: [00:43:30] If you can introduce me to both then that would be great. And then we'll invite them for an upcoming episode. Absolutely. Thank you so much, Chad.</p><p>Our time is up. Unfortunately. Thank you so much for sharing all your insights. I think there are, there's a lot of knowledge in there and as we can definitely use and hopefully apply it to our own zero work. Thanks. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye. And this concludes the season three episode two of the &nbsp;podcast with Chad Sanderson.</p><p>Make sure to check out the show notes on the zero fate websites. Next episode I talk with El Tina Vaughn veer. She's head of experience and insights at engineers. And we're talking about a why humans using data, especially in these times of the crease. The human contact is so important. Talk to you then, and always be optimizing.</p>",false,

My name is . I show you the behind the scenes optimization themes about data driven. And implementing cultural education and the validation in case you missed it. The previous thing was as Jay Davis</p><p>in the house, you level up, you can listen to that.</p><p>Now this episode is made possible by our apartment's online dialogue sites. Bye. Influence institutes and welcome to season two, episode five, Joel, a warm welcome to the cafe. You have to start off with. We always like to know our guests better. So let's start out with </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:01:07] how you became </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:08] involved with </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:01:09] zero.</p><p>Yeah. So my journey to Sierra was basically a series of falling ass backwards into different roles. I didn't knew know existed until they were my job. I started out. I just started, I, this wasn't really a thing when I was, it's not like I dreamt of growing up to be a conversion copywriter.</p><p>It wasn't a role really. direct response exists, but I was oblivious to it. And so I started out very much I always loved writing, never saw a career in it all. I didn't want to be a journalist. I didn't want to, be an author. And so a whole world of writing, marketing writing, and yeah.</p><p>Then conversion copy later on, I was just blind to it. went through university, wound up doing a degree in entrepreneurship because I liked being around people who did things. And didn't just talk about doing things. I like the practical application and that kind of energy wound up at an agency doing SEO.</p><p>so that was the first. the very first sort of job that I had that I didn't realize was a thing until it was my job. So all of a sudden I'm agency side, and now it's my job to optimize for search engines. And so there, I got my first introduction to the world of analytics and the fact that, okay, the work that we do can influence search engines, but I almost got, I got like simultaneously a great education there and a bad education there.</p><p>The great education was seeing, okay. The analytics side and being able to measure all of this. And that's where I started to get introduced to the whole idea of the online conversion of the bad education I would say is at the time I was in SEO, every emphasis on the copywriting side was like a bad emphasis.</p><p>It was like, how can we get keywords as many as possible into this thing? How can we, it wasn't, they didn't see, I was with was not a spammy agency. We did things right. But the prevailing knowledge was like contact was second and there's all this other stuff that went into SEO.</p><p>And then the Panda update happened. And all of a sudden the entire industry started to turn its face towards content. And all of a sudden this skill that I had kept in my back pocket and even told the agency, Hey, if there's an opportunity, like I enjoy doing it, but I don't, I understand all of a sudden it was one of the most valuable skill sets I had.</p><p>So I started writing for our blog and then I started writing web pages for clients. And then I started expanding on what I was doing on the SEO side. And now I was seeing this joint alignment of. analytics and creativity and the way the two played off each other. fast forward to 2013, I knew my time at the agency was coming to an end.</p><p>I knew that I didn't want to do SEO forever. So in 2013, as this whole trend of online content was really getting attention. I thought it's time for me to go out. It's time for me to go and do this. I had been building up my client base while at the agency taking all my first projects getting used to that.</p><p>So in 2013 in July, I went out on my own. Originally focused on content and I enjoy it, that it was very safe. It was very easy for me. But then I was introduced to the work of Joanna Wiebe, the queen bee of conversion copywriting, anyone in the industry who doesn't know, who do you want to is Gola corrupt.</p><p>You're going to fall in love with her work and what she's done and the way she teaches things. but Joanna was my first taste of seeing that direct response copy could be applied really well to the web. And then it didn't have to be sketchy. So I had seen in the past, like my early exposure to the field I'm in now.</p><p>Was like the really sketchy, we've all seen them, like the long form sales pages with 10 different fonts and awkward highlighting, and then a picture of software in a box, even though no one buys software in a box anymore. But it might, really again, negative. And it's honestly scared me the field because.</p><p>I was nervous about the idea of having to have my copy tied to a direct outcome. It felt like a big leap for me. So I was hesitant to get into it. And then when I met Joanna on digitally and saw her work and saw, no, I don't have to Hawk fitness. I don't believe in, I don't have to be, a shady.</p><p>it's not about manipulating people. It's about helping them understand now being to make intelligent decisions and using the moment. Yeah, they have, then it was sold. And so now all of a sudden, all this education I'd been getting in the background of understanding the analytical side and my love of writing.</p><p>Finally, I had a home for it. I had a role for it. And that was conversion copy. And so that was in about 2014. And ever since then, I haven't looked back. It's been my core focus on my own consulting work, and I've been trying to level up the, my own analytical skills and all of that since then. So that is the story of how I wound up in a role that I didn't know existed.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:37] We'll get an idea of what kind of projects are you working on right now? besides becoming a father for a second time. So yeah. approach, hopefully wind down a bit for you a couple of weeks. but about what kind of, copywriting, work are you doing </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:05:49] really focus on the, marketing sites side of things?</p><p>Landing pages? I work with a lot of software companies and subscription-based services. And while I can do across the entire funnel. So I have worked on ads and I work on landing pages. I've done email nurture sequences, and I do sometimes take on all of those pieces for a client where I'm deepest, where I'm most focused is that landing page primary marketing site.</p><p>I get called into a lot of situations when companies are either considering a redesign or considering a pivot in their business. So for example, with HubSpot, they were moving both the redesign of the site and then also introducing a freemium model. And what's the implication of this on our funnels and our copy and all of that.</p><p>I get brought into situations too, where things aren't converting, the way they should be or leadership thinks they could be. And so my job is not only just to bash a keyboard and write new words, but to diagnose why might this not be converting? what could we change? Why should we change those things?</p><p>So I do a lot of analysis strategy and research, and then I'm focusing a lot on the core marketing sites, the landing pages, and then inevitably touching on pieces like the ads as well. And then whenever it's email, I team up with someone like valgeisler smarter away. They're specialists. They're really deep on the email side.</p><p>I just love the copy piece of that. most recently my last project was for a company called union Creek. they are a supply chain, softwares for CPG brands. And so solving problems like they're to give a practical example, it's an integrated platform, two different products and two different audiences, small to midsize businesses, an enterprise, and the enterprise only cares about one of the two products they'll only ever buy the one, but small to midsize businesses might get both.</p><p>And then the pricing that they have is very modular. So a lot of like complex situations, I get brought in to bring some structure to that, understand how do we position and sell this diagnose and fix conversion issues and set companies up to convert better. So that's a lot of what my focus is on now.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:54] zero in general. the work with the D analysis, looking at the customer side of things, but just specialized on the copy side of things will be, would that be accurate description? </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:08:05] There's a lot of, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:06] is there a love zero elements in your work? </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:08:08] There has to be. Yeah. I go through the same process that I think a lot of CRO people do and would have to, but yeah.</p><p>Specific to copy. There are elements that are really critical. A lot of conversion people will focus on the design and for example, fantastic company called the good and they do e-commerce here. And they are really good at looking at the actual design elements and the user experience elements my job though, while it touches on that.</p><p>And I contribute to conversations around that and inevitably wind up, suggesting changes to that. My job is really helping my clients understand how their customers think and make decisions. What motivates them, what pain points do they have, what outcomes do they want? And importantly, how do they talk about those?</p><p>So a huge amount of my research that is sometimes a little bit unique. Is getting that voice of customer data and doing surveys, doing customer interviews, trying to look at again, what motivates them getting beyond like the cardboard cutout persona, like in marketing, everyone talks persona half the time their things invented around a boardroom table that have no grounding in reality.</p><p>My job is to flush that out and make that a real person and challenge the assumptions there. So I look a lot at how people make decisions and I look a lot at. How they talk about those decisions, how they interpret information and bring that back into the topic yesterday's brainstorm was so good. I really liked step's idea of running that test on the call to action buttons, making them orange will really make them stand out.</p><p>Don't you think? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:43] Yeah. Do you want to design a real AB test winners and achieve enormous conversion uplift, then stop, brainstorming and take a difficult </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:09:51] brush. If you can read Dutch </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:53] follow the steps and online influence the best seller management book Delta now, and rule in the office course and become an expert in applying proven behavioral signs yourself.</p><p>Go to &nbsp;dot com for more information and free down notes. So more. Do you know if you're speaking, there are a lot of neuro specialists of course, listening to this podcast since we're focusing on CRO, you're specifically, trained to look at the copy of things. what do you </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:10:22] see if you </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:23] meet or talk to, or see the work of, more generics heroes specialists?</p><p>What do you see? What are the mistakes that we make? </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:10:30] or </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:31] whether it's assumptions about the job that you do or the actual implementation of copy or is, and using, the research and how we. Use that to, to improve things. </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:10:40] I think sometimes there's a bias toward design and don't get me wrong. I love working with conversion, people who are deep on the user experience.</p><p>And, but I think there's a bias to w when that's the tool in your toolkit, that's always how you want to solve the problem. Restructure the page, look at where the attention is going and so on and so forth. I think some misconceptions about my job is that it's just branding or it's just positioning. But the work I do goes beyond that.</p><p>It's my job to understand again, how do people make decisions? What information do they need to hear and how do they need to hear it? What order do they need to hear it in? how do we communicate that in a way that's actually going to hit home for them? It goes beyond, it's a lot of like hallmark things about my field that people just take for granted as yeah, that's obvious.</p><p>Like we all hear features versus benefits and right. To the benefit, not to the feature. In some cases, it makes more sense to write to the feature when you understand the awareness level of the people you're talking to. Or a lot of people think, shorter pages are better or people don't read.</p><p>That's one that I hear all the time, like even from seasoned converted me. no, this page is too long. There's no way they're going to read that. I think the thing is. My job, everyone, everyone that I know that's excels in conversion cares deeply about the people on the other end of the conversion and the whole psychology of it that, but I think my job gets ratcheted up to another level where it's that motivation peace.</p><p>So I think some of the common mistakes that I see are just treating copy, Window dressing or an afterthought, or it's we'll engineer the design. And then, the copy will make fit into the rest of it, or it doesn't really bear that much weight. I think a lot of the time too, where there's the temptation for someone who doesn't know the design side, to come in and start making recommendations, like change a button color, put this there and thinking that's what conversion optimization is.</p><p>Similarly on the copy side, people say, let's just test the headline or let's just test the button copy. But a lot of what I do. Is understanding, for example, something that's commonly overlooked as the awareness level. if we use the analogy of a suitcase, I need to, if I want to take you on a trip, if we want to go somewhere together and you're carrying a suitcase, I need to understand what you've already got packed and what I need to help you pack to get you to the point that, we can go somewhere.</p><p>If we want to go to Antarctica and you've got a suitcase full of bathing suits, I need to help you pack a park on warm clothes and so on and so forth. So too with awareness level, what someone brings into the conversation with them, how much they know already directly influences what you should say to them and how you should say it.</p><p>It's possible to have a beautiful, wonderful, perfectly engineered user experience. And it's possible to understand all the pain points and benefits, but if you communicate those things in the wrong way, at the wrong time, you'll lose the conversion anyways. So those are some things that kind of get glossed over or overlooked.</p><p>it's easy to treat copy, just like I say, in the same way that people disrespect, design. Yeah. And treat it like decoration. It's absolutely not. It's easy to look at copy. And I think sometimes it's just words or it's just what we can just test every part of it. Or we should just it's this formulaic approach when really.</p><p>It's communication. It's a lot of understanding that goes in </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:50] and I can imagine nuts often when new ones size our design, they start with a wire frame. But then you are basically, you are already stuck because then it's already defined how much space you have for your copy while. It might </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:14:03] feel, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:04] very illogical to someone like you.</p><p>And he's saying, but I'm might need more or less, or, </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:14:08] yeah, that's really the thing. And the best projects that I've worked on, something I've had to learn. And that I actually love now is as the copywriter, my job is to study user experience, study design so that I can have intelligent conversations.</p><p>So I'm not coming at it from a myopic. Copy first, all the time mentality. Cause a great designer will take a concept I've written and find a way to visually present it. That's better just better than I could even think of him when I can think a little bit on the design end or that side of things.</p><p>My copy becomes better. Similarly, if you draw all the pictures for the story before you define what the story is, how do you know there's going to be this alignment there? So all of them, the best projects I've worked on have been with. Conversion focused designers are Ceros who get that the two interplay really well.</p><p>I think there's like a mantra of the copy should always inform the design should always, for me, it's not like that the best way to do this is right. I write to a wireframe, but not because I'm trying to take a designer's job or to my way or the highway, but so that communication can be iterative.</p><p>So I need to know how to wire frames so that I can go to a designer and say, here's what I'm thinking. Can you make it better? And instead of copy, like defining design, I prefer to look at it as there's an opportunity Trinity, to do this in lock step. Whereas, yes, I need to have the space and the opportunity to communicate in a way that will make sense for that person to buy in and to get the information they need.</p><p>Yeah. I'm not writing off the fact that a designer may come back with a better way of not saying what I need to say, but designing it or making, bringing clarity through the communication of design. So it's really the best relationships happen when both sides know enough about the other to be dangerous.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:54] Again, communication also within the team. Completely. So you just mentioned something, I want to dive a bit deeper and you said, sometimes a well, but the default, is that okay? Yeah, we should mention benefits. Not necessarily features. I think this is a nice example. So when would you say how well are you actually do </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:16:11] need to talk about features here?</p><p>Yeah, for example, with software, We're not, but by the time someone that does so much happens away from the site, now that by the time someone arrives on your marketing site, Yes on the homepage of certain pages that you might be the first solution they come across, but often they're already coming.</p><p>We talk about that suitcase analogy. Often they already have identified their problem. They know they've got a problem. They know that they need to solve it. They've already identified. Multiple solutions are out there. And in the case of software, especially, they're just trying to compare solutions and find out can this solve X problem that I have.</p><p>It's not that we now throw out the window talking about benefits in any case, but we need to understand the motivation and awareness level of whoever's evaluating the solution that brings to the table. So with union create, this was the exact case. We think that by this time, by the time that they arrive on the site, we have content there to help educate people at the very early stages who are just realizing their pain.</p><p>We have blog posts, we have, different parts of the site that are responsible for helping them understand, Oh, if you're experiencing this pain, there's a solution like this, but the actual product pages. So when you go to their operations management page, There's the hero section that very quickly establishes what this is and who it's for and a little bit of why they should care, what makes them unique.</p><p>But the section that immediately follows is just, what's different about union crate. And we want to get that out of the way right away. Cause we know at this juncture, the average person coming in has a short list of things that they're going, okay, I need this. I need this. And what they need to know is what makes you different or special.</p><p>They don't need to be told, if you have this problem, you should get a solution like this. Here's how this solution works. Yes. They want to see the mechanism, but they're past that. To some degree. So by communicating very quickly, these are the features that are unique to them. Ah, and then the benefit of those features, that's uniquely tied to those.</p><p>We can get that out of the way we can help those people. who are highly motivated, much more aware, make a purchase decision. So the blindly, blindly applying best practice in any scenario can be lethal. Because when you don't take into consideration how much your audience knows, where they're at, what point of the journey they're on, then you run the risk of applying a best practice in the worst possible scenario.</p><p>And it's not gonna, it's not going to serve you. Yeah, exactly. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:31] Like I said, for example, with software, you can tell me all the benefits, but. Can I just please get a confirmation that it actually works on a Mac or on a windows? What I want to know right now, or can I indeed plug in my HD my cable or use BC?</p><p>Doesn't </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:18:46] have that board. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:47] can I actually use this </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:18:48] if I want, if I buy it at some point you're, the lead is beyond. Like with a novel solution when you're brand new to the market, then yes, describing the mechanism becomes really important because if you're a brand new way to solve an old problem, then you need to spend more time educating them on the how, or if you're dealing with people who are just realizing they've got a pain point.</p><p>So for the first time they're opening their eyes and going, yeah, this sucks. I want a solution, but I don't know what's out there. It's a different conversation. Like a dumb analogy that I'll use is if we imagine that we're at a restaurant we're sitting across from each other and you have something in your teeth, if you've never heard of floss before, and I say, Oh, you've got something in your teeth.</p><p>Then I need to spend some time explaining to you why philosophy is how you should use it. And then I might say, Oh, here's why floss is better than a toothpick and so on and so forth. typically the more I have to say to bring you to the point that you can go, yes, I'd like to buy some floss, but if you already know you've got something in your teeth, Thankfully, you know what floss is cause God help us.</p><p>If you don't then I just need to, the only thing I need to tell you is, Hey, I've got some floss right here and it's on sale or 50 cents. And enough at that point to buy it. So ignoring that leads to some really stupid decisions, because if we assume everyone is only paying aware, when the vast majority of people coming in are all the way down here, then we're wasting their time with really long copy.</p><p>But then if we assume that people understand all this. And they don't. now we're leaving huge parts of the conversation out. So a big part of my job is helping companies identify where people at with this, what does that journey look like? How do we communicate back </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:26] to them? Fight spec offer say worldwide unique, AB testing, personalization and product recommendation solution.</p><p>SiteSpect works the service sites without any tags or scripts, which guarantees an ultimate performance, the size solution eliminates delays and the chancellor, the flickering effects. And this approach also ensures that the current and future brows </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:20:48] like ITP and ETP </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:49] does make an impact </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:20:50] on your AB testing translations for more info </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:54] visit &nbsp;dot com.</p><p>I never actually considered the selling foster, the person I'm having dinner with, but that's so that's a great new business idea, actually, </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:21:03] Uber to venture. Yeah. yeah, there's a lot of like lettuce or broccoli or things that get stuck in teeth and you can really, that's a good one rack of a lot of dollars.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:12] So wait, when you with a new clients, where do you start? I can imagine so many things you can do and you can bring to the table, but you have a new clients. </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:21:21] So we always, before we just start swinging a hammer around, we want to understand what we're trying to build and what's actually going on.</p><p>So my work always happens in at least two phases and often three, and I'll quickly cover the first two that always happens. The first one is always analysis and strategy. And in this phase we're looking at, okay, information, do we have about the customer? What do we need to go and get? And then I help engineer the research process to go and get this.</p><p>So what I mean by this is, for example, have they done any surveying of customers, like systematic surveying of customers to understand how they come in, why they make the decisions they do and so on and so forth. Have they done any customer interviews? We'll look at that. Do they have chat logs? I want to analyze chat logs to get a sense of what questions are being asked, how frequently I look for patterns in things like surveys, like interviews like chat logs.</p><p>Two types of patterns. One is language. How do they talk about these types of things, but two are the themes. What types of things are they talking about? So for example, in chatlogs yes, often everyone's going to ask about with software, for example, the price, what's the price, what's the price, what's the price.</p><p>But if I'm seeing to join example from some work I did for an online divorce company, when we separated the questions being asked by men and women, we saw very different trends. Men were converting more often. Women were not. So we started looking, we wondered why that is, especially when in the real world women initiate divorce more often than men, the secret answer, lay in the chat logs and the reviews we saw, women were asking more questions surrounding things like I have dependence.</p><p>How will that be handled? Do I have to sit down across from my spouse to make this happen. They more likely to be fearful of their spouse, have dependents, have questions about property. We weren't answering those questions in the copies. So by looking at somewhere like chatlogs, we've got to fill in the gaps.</p><p>So surveys, interviews, looking at chat logs, but then a lot of things that a typical. conversion person would do so watching recorded user sessions to see where the attention is going, looking at things like Google analytics to see the paths that they take through the site. For me, those things are valuable to see what type of information they're seeking out.</p><p>If someone comes to a landing page and then goes to another page on the site, what was the informational need that led them to do that? I want to pinpoint things like that. So the first thing I'll do with the client is designed the battery of research to close the gap on the information that we need.</p><p>We need to understand the client's pain points, desires, anxieties, hesitations. and then we also need to understand how they interact with the information. If there's a live site right now, how the interact with the information today. So I go away, I collect all of that. I come back to them with my findings.</p><p>Can we talk about the strategy? How does this impact copy? why should we restructure things or should we restructure things? And so on from that point, phase two is always the copywriting and wire framing. So when I work with clients, as I mentioned, we talked about earlier, I'm always writing to a wireframe first.</p><p>there's the obvious reason for that and the less obvious reason for that. So the obvious reason is I want to have better conversations around design. I don't want to have I'm a Google doc and have them go, okay. I guess we have to figure out how to present this. So that's the obvious one. The less obvious one is I don't typically want a client to edit my copy.</p><p>So I put it in a that's harder to edit. I want to have a conversation around the why and not the, what I don't want to say a word doc where their propensity is going to be. I don't like that word. Oh, I don't know if I send it to them and they can see a bit of the design and they can see a little bit of the presentation.</p><p>And I always, whenever I send a wire frame with copy, yeah. I always either present it on a call. Or send a video, talking through every, why did I do this? Why did I orchestrate it? Cause I think in conversion, it's really important to move away from opinion personal preference. And I don't like that one, not like that and make the conversation more about the under underpinning strategies and hypotheses that we're putting forward.</p><p>So that's the second phase. And then the third phase is the ongoing, AB testing, split testing, and so on. This is something that most version people do all the time. for my situations often I'm dealing with clients where they don't have the statistical significance. They don't have thousands of conversions that we can always measure this in like a month time.</p><p>So it's not that we ignore this. It's not that I don't ever say, let's. The split test this, and that's a key piece to the conversion puzzle. but often then I'll bring it up partners or I become a smaller part of a larger team. And then we work collaboratively to. Look at the hypotheses on, at a cadence that makes sense for the client and so on.</p><p>So that's a high level of how a project would look, but the most involved and intensive part is that first phase, when we're collecting all that Intel interpreting it, trying to draw some meaningful conclusions from the voice of customer and the way that they behave today, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:26:03] projects, whether it's yourself British from your own company or, colleagues in the field doing copywriting.</p><p>when those projects don't work out with clients, W what are the most common pitfalls? what are the most common reasons that those, that it doesn't work out </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:26:15] for? Whatever one is failure to set expectations? I think I always have the conversation at the outset, that, Hey, what we're doing, we're going to root it in data.</p><p>We're going to spend a lot of time on research and analysis. We're going to spend the time to get to know the why behind the decisions that we make. But I always communicate like. There's always a risk that it's not going to convert because behavior is surprising. The, it's so where we want to go with it, your head.</p><p>And so the client needs come in with the same mindset of discovery and analysis and experimentation. And when they think it's just a money machine, like put in a dollar, get 10 out that's when things really break down. I think team dynamic when teams don't talk to each other that can break things down.</p><p>So I always want to be plugged into. The design people, the SEO people leadership. Before I write a word of copy, I'll have a meeting. All of the different seats that are on the table have an opportunity to share their perspective because when you don't do that, then you start getting pushback from teams who had nothing to do with the research process.</p><p>So everyone for me has to be part of that strategy piece, not necessarily informing it, but they have to understand why we're making the changes we do. Because when you're an SEO, I wasn't SEO one year in SEO. The only lens you look at things through is it going to rank? Whereas that's not helpful when you're in design.</p><p>If you're not paying attention, the only thing is, does it look the way I want it to so not getting buy in cross-functionally from teams is a big way that falls apart. And then the last one I would say is, and this has come back to bite me in big ways. You can't always control for it. Leadership has to be involved.</p><p>Even if your point of contact is the marketing team or the sales team, what have you leadership has to buy in? They have to believe because otherwise what happens and this happened on has happened on real projects. We get 90% of the way through. And then in the homestretch, some VP swings in there Hey, I had this crazy fever dream and now the direction of the company is different.</p><p>So can you just change everything you just did? And that will kill a project when. When leadership doesn't understand or see the why or isn't privy or part of the discussion, it can totally derail everything. So I think all of those points they'll come down to just. Expectation setting and communication </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:39] culture as the company is try to, to support what we're doing.</p><p>I don't know if you've worked. You've always worked with online, copy. And if you've worked with, with offline, copywriters, and w would you say are some key differences between writing copy, for offline and versus online? </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:28:55] Yeah. the bulk of my work has been online. I did some offline in my early days.</p><p>I think one of the big ones though, I, it seems like an obvious one, but the ability to test and to track online is obscene. Like the amount of information you can get, is while I think too with print. you always have to be clear on your objective, like with a print ad or what have you oftentimes like if I was to write a sales letter offline, then you know, it's, it can only ever be one piece, Because it's literally printed out. There's nothing dynamic about it. So you have to nail that one format. There's, there's not a whole lot of room to experiment and change things. It takes longer to get that feedback from the offline world. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:42] I think previously in magazines, they did do some AB testing with like covers or something, in shops.</p><p>but of course, like you said, that takes a very much, the timeline is </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:29:52] completely different. And you can't track in the offline world, how someone's eyes go through the page. So on and so forth. The other thing too, is those speaking to that dynamic piece with online now and with where tools are going.</p><p>not that this is, I think personalization gets used as this like monkey wrench answer for everything, which I don't believe it is. I think we're only, it works in some cases, but. With digital, you have the opportunity to make rapid changes and you do have the ability to iterate as you're learning. So with tools like, right message or other tools out there you can actively plan for.</p><p>Okay. If throughout this process, we learned that this is one type of person and not the other, you can, on the go have the copy, adjust to that person. You can't do that with. A print ad. You can't have it be that dynamic and responsive, which is increasingly where the tools are getting easier, cheaper, better online.</p><p>So that's another big opportunity and difference to the online side of things. So basically </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:52] online where spoiled. </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:30:53] Yeah. Super spoiled. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:55] Yeah. Marketing budgets have suffered. And the sheriff for AB testing has been impacted too. If you want to keep that thing to enterprise standards, but safe, 80% on your annual contract, you can consider a comfort with their summer release.</p><p>You can take advantage of full stack and hybrid features, strong privacy compliance, </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:31:15] no blink. And </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:31:17] enterprise great security </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:31:20] feel good about your smart business decision in Fest. What you </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:31:24] saved back in your CRO program, check out www adult's overbook </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:31:29] slash 2020. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:31:33] I think you, you wanted to share another a case study, from a HubSpot.</p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:31:36] Yeah. HubSpot was an example. I alluded to it before, but HubSpot was an example of a company going through transition. And there's a lot of the things that we talked about when right. In this project. So with HubSpot, they were introducing this freemium model, but they are also on this insanely tight deadline.</p><p>And I think with conversion, we all have the processes we like to go through in an ideal scenario, but this was a case where we were in such a time crunch that we couldn't do everything. So we had to be ruthless about, okay, what research can we actually do? Do, and how can we apply it? And the HubSpot case study is a really good example of.</p><p>How you make a team dynamic work in conversion and how you make it possible to like the dynamic it takes to achieve really great things on a tight timeline. The end product was that HubSpot doubled their conversions. Across the board and then sub metrics to that. Like it wasn't just sign up to a free trial.</p><p>Now, even inbound call volume went up, the number of requests to support and customer success not only changed. So success stopped hearing some of the questions that they're tired of answering, but improves the types of questions where. like different. And with this project, we had this tight timeline, so we had to be ruthless.</p><p>We could only look at so much. And so that sort of battery of research that we talked about was truncated. All we could do was customer interviews and some serving there wasn't a whole lot of time to look at behavior through the site beyond some simple things like. Heat maps and the tiny, that type of thing.</p><p>I worked in tandem with another copywriter named Joshua, and what made that project really work was their designer at the time was Austin Knight. And I mentioned earlier, this was my first exposure to a designer, really got and valued and could contribute to the copy piece and everything we did.</p><p>Austin found a way to make better everything we wrote. He found a way to present in a more intelligent way, right? It was the first time that we had to oftentimes there's this, okay. The copywriter writes here, then you pass it. The designer and then moves on. This was the first time I had the opportunity to have by necessity, this iterative process of together, we defined cause timelines were so tight.</p><p>Sure. Pages. We defined a template that we knew based on the information we had about customer. This was the conversational flow. That these pages needed to have. We didn't have to copy even yet, but we knew these are the types of sections we need in there. We need them based on what we know about the customer.</p><p>So we are able to go away and write the copy. Austin was able to go away and do the design because we were pulling in the same direction. We had the same baseline work towards. And then it became this iterative compare and contrast. And instead of saying no, but which is a very defeating relationship, it was a yes.</p><p>And so yes, this is great. Or yes, this is working and we could do it this way or, yes, this is a good idea and we can adjust it in these ways. So it was the first time there was this really iterative process. And that has defined for me since the way that I try to work with broader conversion teams or with designers.</p><p>So we got the great outcome, obviously the big lifting conversion, big lift and inbound calls, big, both anecdotal. And I don't know, remember the metrics at this point, but support teams saw less, less questions coming in and more of the right types of questions. but it was just a really good lesson in being ruthless about the research, doing a lot with a little, and then working as a team.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:35:02] Yeah. I think it does really impede your work if you're working with people that are, if they're not open to that feedback and they. They see you as someone, whether it's four, four copy or zero in general, where if they see you as someone attacking yeah. Their work, whether it's a marketeer or a designer, some people just have that mindset that did you come in, basically critiquing their awards.</p><p>I think, no, you shouldn't do this like this you're there are different ways you should change this. And, I find it really hard also to change that mindset. it's not something that's just a flip of a switch and say, Oh, that's really hard. if they don't have that mindset to begin with, </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:35:39] it's even difficult now.</p><p>Like I think the thing is, especially on the writing front, this is something conversion. Optimization folks should understand about writers. Everyone pours themselves into their work, but writers even more. So we get so into the work we're doing that. It becomes a routine flushing. Like we put time when you're working with someone.</p><p>Good. They have thought through every line, they've got a reason behind every piece. They can explain what they've done, we get attached to it. And so even though now, and I'm the first to say, there can't be any ego in conversion optimization. Cause you, if you haven't been wrong yet, you haven't been testing properly.</p><p>you can't have </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:36:19] it zero people. they are used. To being wrong because that's </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:36:25] yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:36:27] Yeah. It's usually, it's a humbling experience. that might not be the experience of the people you start working with, whether it's in design and or in marketing say, yeah, we always do campaigns like this, or we've always done doing, been doing designs like this.</p><p>And that's </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:36:40] always been even for myself, even to this day, though, I have learned to. It is it's like you say, it's not easy to just flip a switch and for me, because you get so invested, it's hard not to take criticism. Personally, being in conversion helps that and having objective data certainly helps that, but I've learned even to give myself a breathing period where I, I get better at this as years go on, but as I send something over, when the revisions come in, I read it once and I don't respond to it.</p><p>Until, at least a few hours later. Cause you don't, that's the other thing that can kill you as being reflexive is taking offense or immediately wanting to change something. Sometimes there have been many times something that's been pointed out or someone has said, okay, but this isn't actually working that well.</p><p>And so on. And given time to breathe, I come back and say, you know what? They're right. I couldn't see it. Cause I was so invested in what I put together. Yeah. So that's a lesson that copywriters need to learn, but also it's a good thing for those who work with copywriters to be aware of is there is this very personal attachment to the words that you write.</p><p>And so when you deliver criticism, it's okay. You need to do it to be productive, but. Let them have a little bit of time to breathe on it. sit on it, breathe it in. And then a good person's going to come back and be able to, what you're right. Or, you know what the data says, this variant that I liked a lot garbage.</p><p>it is again, we keep coming back to, but it is a communication piece. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:38:03] Take some time to nurture that culture. As you started working with a new company that they don't have this optimization mindset or they dabbled failed enough yet. it takes some time. do you remember, by the way from, from the sports Pittsburgh, what were the biggest, I would say gaps between, the Daryl original contents, before you started optimizing them and what </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:38:23] a lot of it, specific to the first piece that I worked on there was they had unrolled this new product.</p><p>this was one of the big things. Is, there was a lack of clarity around what HubSpot even was at that point because they had forever been a marketing tool. So it was perception in the market that HubSpot was a marketing tool marketing plan. Yeah. And in the meantime, in the months and year prior, HubSpot had rolled out a CRM, they'd rolled out a sales tool and the big gap was nowhere.</p><p>Had they done the hard work. Of showing clients. And you can find this line hopefully on the site to this day that these products are powerful alone, but better together, there was no real men, content that linked them together. And there was a real lack of clarity at the time around which tool did what.</p><p>And do I need just this one to accomplish X task? Or do I need both of these pieces? So that was reflected in, for example, we saw in the chat logs that we looked at, a lot of the questions were surrounding things like, do I need this to do that? Which tool is right for me? And so by introducing sections, like the powerful alone, but better together, and then breaking out, showing the impact of all of them, but then it making it clear which individual tools helped achieve, which individual tasks, a lot of conversion stuff seems obvious when you step back from it.</p><p>But. In the moment, it's hard to identify that was the gap. So that was certainly one thing. The other was a lot of the landing pages that we worked on. just that awareness level. So understanding again, like what mentality someone came into the page with what their priorities were. So part of what we did in looking at the survey feedback, in talking about the features, cause these are like crazy multi future tools.</p><p>They have like more features than yeah. Like some people, not me. Yeah. Obviously you have strands of hair. Like it's, there's a crazy amount of features in looking at the survey data, we're able to pinpoint the most commonly desired uses cases and talk about them first in the page. So rather than trying to give everything equal weight or like eventually meandering to it.</p><p>We're able to restructure the pages based on the leads priority. And that made a difference because people got the information they needed more quickly and were more likely to. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:40:25] Okay. And, so now looking forward, after things have settled down with a second baby, and you've been able to sleep again, what will be the things that you say, okay, the next 12 months, this is what I really would like to work on this, these kind of projects, or maybe some, improvements to the process that you have.</p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:40:39] So this is dual-sided, cause I run another company that's like hockey, sticking and growth. So part of my priority will be managing the growth of case study buddy. But on the conversion side, I think what I'm really excited about, is two things. One is that personalization piece. I haven't had enough opportunity to really play around with it and make it meaningful.</p><p>I think it's a playground because there's so much we can do that. We don't know what we should yet. and so I'm excited to work with more companies on that front and, finding out like, does this work? How should we use this, these tools that are available to us? So that's one thing.</p><p>And then for me personally, I think, my career continues to evolve. I mentioned like I've been SEO agency and then writing content like blogs and eBooks. And then now, doing the role that I have and increasingly I still love the copy piece of things and that stuff forever will be, my output, but we're, I'm trying to go deeper and love up more.</p><p>There's the overarching strategy of conversion getting better at the design piece, getting better. I know my weak spot, even though, what I'm good enough to be dangerous is really the analytical side and getting better with the analytics and statistics part of all of this. So for me personally, that's what I'm excited to.</p><p>Explore a bit more for my own learning and then industry trend as a whole, I'm excited to push the limits and see if this personalization stuff is all it's cracked up to be. Or if it's really just another bell and whistle, on the stack that we already have to play with </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:42:08] as a small sidestep.</p><p>the hockey stick projects or company even. A case study, buddy, what are you doing there? </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:42:14] it's, it's pretty unique in that it's a team specialized for customer success stories. All we do is help B to B companies capture, share, and cash in on customer success stories. And so we do it for a lot of agencies, a lot of software companies, increasingly coaches and consultants.</p><p>And it's a tough challenge that. Anyone who's tried to get by and for a customer success story and then put that together and then get approval for it. And then presented in a way that actually drives action, which is where my whole conversion background comes in. It's a complex process and one that over the past four years, my team and I have gotten really good at solving.</p><p>That space for us is really blue. Ocean's still, we don't have a ton of competition that we are seeing more people come into the field and we're expanding the format. So we started out written cause that's my background, but we're doing a lot more of the video and we're moving towards more of the subscription, strategic type models.</p><p>So where, when we started, we're all about the production side, we run the interview. We write the studies, we manage getting revisions. We design the end assets, but where we're really excited about increasingly doing more of is the strategy behind these types of pieces. So what types of stories should companies even tell?</p><p>How do we build feedback loops and systems into their organization so that when they go to ask for a customer success story, it doesn't feel like a stranger coming and asking for a favor. So I'm really excited to just be shaping the strategic parts of that company. Growing the team there and then constantly, really honing and getting better at the formats.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:43:44] so basically as a business goal goes to you guys say, Hey, I have this bind, here's his email address. Please give me a testimony. </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:43:51] Yeah, pretty much that. but in some cases we can even come in a step earlier. So often we deal in situations where increasingly working with midsize to enterprise where they say, we have lots of happy customers.</p><p>We have no idea how to approach them to get them to say yes or there might be a lot of. nuances legal nuances where </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:44:10] it's we don't know if they're willing to test. We don't know if they're happy. </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:44:13] Yeah. All the way back to that. So we're increasingly helping clients get buy in the first place.</p><p>the goal is so that it becomes almost as push button as possible. So we do get a brief from them and we do that type of thing, but we want to make these as fast, frictionless and fun as possible for everyone to be part of. And so that's, that is the model is, yeah. Company says either. We've got a happy customer or increasingly multiple happy customers.</p><p>And we want to know how to feature them, but where we're moving is more of a service where we can set a target and they can say, we want to be able to publish. Four studies a year or eight studies or 12 studies in a year. And we helped them engineer the systems and feedback loops to make that possible and then take care of all the creation as well.</p><p>Nice case study, but adult, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:44:59] I will put the link in there in the comments too. as a final question, back to copywriting and any books that you would like to recommend to our audience, I want to learn more about basically copywriting and Sera. </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:45:09] Yeah. The funny thing about covering books and copywriting in general is some of the books.</p><p>It should be, there should be books on copywriting, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:45:15] right? </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:45:15] There are there, but some of the best, most informative books about copywriting are not about copying. So one of my favorite books is made to stick. there are lots of things in that book that talk about making ideas memorable, but also just the guidelines that they present for making things like concrete.</p><p>And that type of thing have really influenced my writing on the specific copywriting front. There's a classic, Dan Kennedy's ultimate sales letter, that takes us all the principles of offline direct response. And. when you read it through the lens of doing this digitally, there are lessons that you will take away from that are very valuable.</p><p>the other ones classic, how to win friends and influence people. there are parallels and lessons there that you can bring across into copy in terms of how you phrase things or how you think about engaging with people. there's also books that I really like predictably irrational that just deal with.</p><p>The psychology of marketing and psychology of how people make decisions in general. And those are the types of books. It's great to read a copywriting book, don't get me wrong. There's books. everybody writes from Ann Handley that talk about the mechanics of writing the strategy of it and so on. But I think the further you get, the more you realize that writing is communication deals with psychology.</p><p>So I'm invested in how people think. And make decisions and then the writing, it's not secondary to it, but then the writing has goalposts to shoot for. I understand how, when I know that then I can engineer what I'm doing to do that better. So those are some books that I've found. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:46:43] Exactly. Joel, thank you so much for, for doing this on such short notice and, while you are, you're waiting for the delivery of your </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:46:50] second </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:46:51] child.</p><p>Good luck with that. tomorrow. The two weekends next week, </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:46:55] whenever it happens </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:46:56] soon, you're probably a father a when we publish this. we'll, everyone that's listening to this can congratulate you, probably on the new baby. thanks again and talk to you soon. Cheers. Thank you so much. All right.</p><p>And this season two episode 35, plus with Joel conversion, copywriter business copywriting next week, another English, </p><p>Joel Klettke: [00:47:22] or at least </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:47:23] three Jewish guys, frying English.

I love it to have you here. you just did a session and, for the people that are see you on live stream or, he was speaking on the podcast cause they might recognize you since a lot of people, I assume. I've watched some Google analytics videos in the past, which you did a lot of.</p><p>I think that's have been a great position to be in and, to be able to share and, teach people to do what you do, what you love. but let's start with your session, today. Yeah. The keynote. And you spoke about digital analytics trends, and, talk about what's next in digital analytics.</p><p>yeah. Tell us what's next. </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:00:37] We talked about is based on some research that I've been doing over the last a month or two, just trying to understand what are the platforms that people are using today to do analytics? What are they looking at tomorrow? what is their game plan when it comes to how they are planning out their digital future, for the businesses.</p><p>And what I've been finding is, a lot of people still use. We use Google analytics, Adobe analytics, some of the major providers as their primary platform when it comes to secondary platforms, some of the smaller players are actually becoming much more popular things like mixed panel and heap and amplitude, segment snowplow.</p><p>there's a bunch of things that are starting to pop up that we hadn't heard. Even a couple of. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:19] I think you showed a graph. I saw it on Twitter. but I think 80% of them use. Merchants and a website use the bigger names, and then we have 12 points, seven, 8%, the smaller ones and the rest is in house.</p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:01:37] Yeah. And I think in housing is another trend that we're starting to see. So I think, it was seven or 8% that are using in housing, rolling their own analytics as a primary, platform. But when it comes to secondary platforms, we're seeing it a lot more. So people are starting to use more than one analytics platform.</p><p>And often we're seeing that as they start to do another type of platform, another type of data analysis, it's in house, it's doing their own thing. It's getting those data pipelines together and really figuring out how they can take it to the next level with data science, data mining. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:10] Yes. And what's driving this trend.</p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:02:12] I think I, over the course of the research, the two biggest things that I saw, and these are actually conflicting, trends is this desire to do more yourself, own it in house and really be in control of your own data. and then the other trend I saw was actually a trend towards consolidation and people wanting to do it all in one platform, being able to see across.</p><p>Web and app or cross platform and those kinds of things. So they're a little bit at odds, but I think the underlying, sentiment in all of it is that people want to own their data. They want to be able to get that raw event data and analyze it the way that they want. And I think that the platforms that allow for that are the ones that are going to, continue to be popular in the future.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:50] Yeah. not only just want to own their day now, but with GDPR, especially here in Europe, the need to own part of that. Yeah. That's an important driver </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:03:00] and we're all in one, you mean, and not only devices, but different browsers, different locations. So work home, everything combined. </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:03:07] Yeah, totally. we're a very digital society.</p><p>We have so many different ways of accessing this information and it's really hard as a business to bring it all together, but certainly there's a desire to look at somebody as a user and throughout their entire user journey rather than just a single platform or browser window. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:22] Yeah. And you also spoke about a new feature in Google liters combining a webinar app.</p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:03:27] Yeah, absolutely. one of, one of my favorite things is something that I worked on for about two years before leaving Google earlier this year is their new app and web properties. so I worked on as a product manager and also as that analytics advocate, helping people understand what it is they are building and how it would be useful to users or what were the types of things that we needed to consider.</p><p>as we started to build this new platform. and it's exciting. It builds on the success of Google analysts, thanks for Firebase and we flipped that data model on its head. So it goes from a sessions and page view model that we had in kind of the traditional universal analytics or what we see and Google analytics today.</p><p>And it's moving more towards a, an event and perimeter data model, which is what you actually see in some of the newer platforms like a. in Mixpanel an amputee, those types of things. we're looking at how that data can be more useful in the future. and it's really exciting.</p><p>It works cross platform. It takes that Google analytics, our basis, data, ads, web streams of data is what they're calling. Yeah. So you can have multiple different streams from iOS, Android, web. I suspect we'll see things for like single page apps and all of those types of things. and it brings it all together in one.</p><p>No interface one way to analyze it. and I think, and this speaks to some of the trends that we're seeing in the data. One of the really exciting things of this new platform is actually it's all available via an export with big crew for free as compared to the paid version of Google analytics, where you actually have to pay for that big Cray expert.</p><p>So I think there's a lot of things that we're seeing here that are speaking to some of the trends in the data and where the industry is going. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:01] Yep. And, so in that sense, do you think. Google is Google catching up to the other, competitors out there or are they lagging behind or </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:05:09] yeah, I think you can look at it in a number of ways.</p><p>I'm sure. it's a little bit of catching up in terms of that data model and that being the primary data model. but I also think, it's one of the first platforms out there that truly is bringing together webinars and in a way that you can actually analyze that data across everything.</p><p>there are other platforms that have tried to do it. I think people have had varying degrees of success. One of the things that sets Google part is, its ability to be able to map that user across, a namespace, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:37] it's hard to do. So </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:05:38] it's very hard to do. Of course.</p><p>for years we've been saying well, Oh yeah, of course you can do it. You just need a user identifier. So if you have a login, that's great. Yeah. but most websites don't have a login and you need to really be able to, understand that. And so Google is doing some pretty cool things there to be able to make that much more accessible.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:55] Yeah. And, and we spoke while, today a couple of times. so you advise companies on their analytics, one of the most common things that you see going wrong or. Sure. </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:06:08] one of the things that I actually, I find more often than not is not necessarily that things are wrong or broken. they often are.</p><p>But more that people, companies are not taking advantage of the platforms that they have. Yeah. And I find it really funny because in today's fitness businesses, we have more and more platforms and we continue to buy and onto that marketing tech stack. And yet we're underlying under utilizing the tools that we have.</p><p>And even when it comes to something like Google analytics, I've heard very large, premium three 60 paying customers of Google analytics, say. They had no idea they can create a custom segment or what is a secondary dimension or, we're not using event tracking. And it blows my mind because these are very fundamental ways to get more out of your analytics solution.</p><p>And, in my mind, you shouldn't be investing further in other platforms and trying to pull so much data together until you're actually utilizing the platforms that you have. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:59] Yep. And do you feel this is more of a lack in technical knowledge or is it more about, The strategies, the goals within the company that might not be well-defined </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:07:12] no, I think it's, I think it's both, I think you absolutely need to start with some type of business requirements and know what it is you're trying to track and why.</p><p>And hopefully that leads into the types of, tracking and things that you would implement to be able to answer those questions. But I think there's definitely a lack of knowledge. If you don't know that you can create a custom segment to be able to analyze that data, you're never going to be able to take your analysis to that next level.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:07:33] And so they didn't watch your videos then </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:07:35] I guess they haven't watched my videos, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:37] here's a link. </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:07:38] Hey, you can check out, let me see Academy. I got all those videos to teach you how to do those kinds of things. but there's so many free resources out there for analytics education.</p><p>so I th I think the resources are there. There's still just a lack of kind of knowing that you need to take it to that next level of, if you're not aware that these things exist, all the training in the world could be there. and yet, you're not going to be able to actually utilize the tools.</p><p>Somebody needs to tell you that is there, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:02] especially I think, with Google analytics, for example, we're compared with something like heap, they are recording all the events. Right away after you install heat, but with cooling is you do still a lot of work to do before everything is set up, right?</p><p>The events the e-commerce tracking, I worked for a lot of merchants, so that's something you need to set up and it's not always obvious and straight. </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:08:21] Yeah. So I think actually that's one of the really cool things that I'm excited about in the new app and web properties. So there's this new thing called enhanced to measurement.</p><p>Where it's actually out of the box, you can just toggle on and off a bunch of different events, that we'll track them automatically. Once you flip that toggle. And the entire goal is that they're trying to make it much more accessible and easy for people who are not as technical or don't have the resources to be able to set those things.</p><p>Because up to do things like scroll tracking and outbound link tracking, search result, tracking, and those kinds of things. And it's amazing that, you can just. Kind can flip a switch and that's turned on now. and I think that list of things that you can do through enhanced, measurement's going to continue to expand.</p><p>And I'm really excited to see where they go with it. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:01] That would be really helpful because often you, you want to do an analysis of something that's not measured, then you still have to wait a couple of weeks to get the data. And instead of, Oh, we already have data from. Three years. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:09:11] It's probably going to be like this and like right now, so now they're increasing the data and then the next step is all right.</p><p>So we're going to teach you now what the useful data is to do it actually, so you can act upon it. And so it's probably gonna increase and then decrease that's the normal way it goes, but I'm happy if it would be a lot easier to track things that every normal people would like to track. we still run into eCommerce stores who can.</p><p>Attracting conversions, but don't have the, the order values, for example. Yeah. it's, it makes, working on your CRO a lot harder. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:44] Yeah. And then it also comes back to, to the strategy that the companies I've also worked at a company where day one, I came, wasn't got Google, his buddy, or the eCommerce managers for each country.</p><p>They got a report, based on audit data, just a number of orders compared to what they budgeted for. yeah. W what are you going to act upon? They're just started giving our discounts. That's so painful. If that's not, if the data is not there, and if everyone equal, they knew they were, they're not stupid.</p><p>but if that's the data you get and what you talk about with your manager, then that's what you sure. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:10:15] Step one, determines if you get your bonus or not. Then you're going to give her discounts. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:19] Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Hey, I want a very practical question about the Google analytics videos. How often did you guys have to redo those again?</p><p>Because maybe a personal frustration? it's not. it's also frustration, but also, amazed by our I'll watch developments. it's continually going through. I often find myself lost in Google and let us go, something changed again, </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:10:42] for sure. there are parts of them that we've redone over the years.</p><p>I think the Google tag manager course is probably the, the hardest one to keep up to date. and a lot of those updates came in the form of kind of text box telling you that this has changed. I definitely rerecorded scenes of several over time. But I think in general, the most rerecording was just me stumbling over my words in the studio.</p><p>As we were filming, the first ones had a very patient filming crew helping me. And we had a lot of fun in the studio doing this. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:08] Yeah. What are the things you're looking forward to? let's say next year, what are the technological advancements in our field? What </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:11:15] makes you excited? Yeah. I'm very excited to see where Google goes with this new app and web property.</p><p>I think we're, we're just at the beginning. There's a lot of things that aren't there yet. It doesn't have, enhanced eCommerce yet. although it's coming soon, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:11:26] insider information, </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:11:29] So there's a lot of advancements that are going to come there that are, or helping to get to that use case parody with a universal analytics and then taking it a step farther.</p><p>I think there's a lot of, new features that are app and web only. So for example, the new analysis section that was available or is available in Google analytics, three 60 there's. Some new techniques coming out to analyze your data. And they're coming first and in primarily in the app and web stuff, for example, the padding reports, which were something that I worked on when I was at Google, I helped, build that in launch it.</p><p>And it was actually my personal motto, kill all of the old user reports, a user flow of reports from Google analytics because they were so terrible. so of course, cause that was my motto. I got padding handed to me as something I had to go figure out. but it's exciting. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:13] You started complaining, make it better, go fix it </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:12:17] pretty much Shabbat.</p><p>So that's how Google works in general. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:20] I would </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:12:21] say. Yeah, I'm excited for, to see where that goes. on a more personal note, I'm excited to I really get back into doing digital analytics day to day. So I've recently started my own analytics consulting firm called Ks digital. and I, I'm excited to be helping companies really get into their digital strategy and, analyze their Google analytics data or whatever it might be helping them understand those business requirements and get set up in a way that's going to be really fruitful for them.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:47] Type of clients or segments you're looking for or, </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:12:50] I think you're, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:53] it's a Dutch bolt gasoline. </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:12:56] It depends on the business case. I think my strong suit really is around Google analytics, but just digital strategy in general. I'm looking for clients who are trying to do better with what they're doing online and who may need help auditing what they're doing with Google analytics and setting up a better implementation, setting them a better, solution design and really, driving them.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:15] Okay, cool. And, you've been speaking a lot worldwide also, you'll travel to the Netherlands often. So are there are the big differences that you see in how people, handle. Analytics or, what we do in our general area, where we work in, w how people. And old data. Of course we have a lot less data.</p><p>We tend to have less data here. </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:13:36] what's your view? Yeah, I think, I've seen some really interesting things worldwide. when I was at Google, I spent three months over in Asia doing advocacy for data, over there. Yeah. I think, a lot of those markets are a little less mature in how they're using, analytics data.</p><p>specifically I think some markets are much more mature. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:13:56] I think China's pretty mature with all the cameras they're building </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:13:59] China's decently mature. I'm constantly surprised by actually the Australian market. I think that they in particular, have gone really deep on just like data analysis and getting really technical with data.</p><p>Almost as if they skipped the whole web analytics, behavioral data side of things and dumped everything into a data warehouse and you have to be very technical to be an analyst there. I think there are pros and cons to all of that, by the way. I think the most of the European market is somewhere in the middle, I think.</p><p>they've started to progress pretty significantly. getting more technical. but I think that there's a strong kind of digital analytics, offering here. I do think you get things like GDPR, which takes away some of that data that you can have access to. everybody is starting to feel the pains of that along with other regulations being put in place in the U S we have CCPA coming up, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:48] California.</p><p>Is that right? </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:14:49] it's a California regulation, but any business that does business with anybody in California has to comply. So basically it's all of the U </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:14:55] S just for me, what does it mean? </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:14:57] the California consumer privacy act. So it's the California version almost of GDPR, except for it's the inverse you actually have to, you don't have to get opt-in consent itself without consent.</p><p>Okay. you have to display a message on the, on your website someplace, basically saying that business has the right to sell your data, would just how they've had they've worded it, something like that. which is it's a little bit off putting. So I'm curious to see the impacts of that.</p><p>But then on top of that, you have things like ITP and ETP now with Mozilla where we're losing more and more data. And we have to figure out ways as analysts to work around that, to get the things that we need, so that we can continue to do our jobs. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:33] Yeah. Yeah. those messages might be off putting, but we also have some experience here with GDPR.</p><p>And before that we had a different cookie law, Once every website has it. Yeah. As a user, you </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:15:44] just </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:15:45] it's really? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:46] Yeah. It's really annoying. You just click accept, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:15:49] you, click, whatever they throw it to you just click accept. Yeah. It doesn't matter what things are checked on or checked off or </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:56] yeah.</p><p>Yeah, of course. When you work for companies, they want as many people as possible to accept the ultimate for that. And then you get to over 99% people are accepting and then also. makes it a bit specific </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:16:10] conversion optimization process for the </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:14] cookie. Yeah. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:16:16] The cookie banner popping up. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:17] And it's an important one right now.</p><p>Otherwise you sure </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:16:20] I did a lot of testing actually, in a former role where we actually used something like a user testing.com or validate leap. To go through so many different mocks of, acceptance of different cookie guidelines, and, went from very little acceptance to a place where we felt a little bit more comfortable as a business.</p><p>but definitely something that you need to think about. Don't just slap something up there and hope that everything's going to be okay. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:43] Yep. one of the themes today, diversity, what kind of, segments do you see being very useful for clients to be looking at? often clients. It's especially when it started out, just trying to optimize for the average user.</p><p>which can be art if there's no average, which is a big problem, which can be a big, it can be a big issue or maybe even waste of time if there was no, average user, what kind of segments do you often see being very useful for people in, for </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:17:07] example e-commerce yeah, again, this is really going to depend on the business.</p><p>Some, sometimes things like age and gender demographics, help, and oftentimes, they don't have any impact at all. It's a lot more about that user behavior on site. the things that they're looking at previously, the things they're, showing interest in are great signals for you to be able to then segment that, user experience, offer them more personalized experiences.</p><p>be able to remark it to those users. So I think, while surface level metrics, can sometimes be useful much more often. It's really understanding, what are the major, interests of people on your site. Yeah. And go after those interests </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:45] and demographics can be tricky.</p><p>we just had someone from Vodafone and, Transavia airlines, saying, yeah, we look at Google analytics, demographics, but yeah. Let me try to validate that's not accurate. </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:17:59] Yeah. the demographic data is tough, right? Like you have people who share browsers or computers and various things.</p><p>And that infer data is going to be mixed. I've gotten a nicely. Targeted ads to buy men's clothing. And I'm like, I was just, I searched to buy a shirt for my husband, but I'm not a man and I'm not necessarily looking for that. ongoing. And so I think, you have to take that as a grain of salts or just one input into kind of the overall segment that you're building.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:27] Yeah. And a lot of companies do it. So if you start optimizing, you start creating those segments and. in this case, if someone's looking for men clothing, probably man, but maybe that's the bulk of the group, but then of course you miss out most people that are, for presence. Yeah. Looking for presence.</p><p>And, so for example, I worked at a flower company. It was a 98% gifting. </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:18:48] Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:49] yeah. it was a little Swedish company actually. but it was really hard to ultimize for that person, because this week they will buy something for their mother, for a lover, for, I don't know, funerals. We also did.</p><p>so yeah, if it's a gifting, it's really hard to optimize for that. did they can have a, a favorite flower themselves? Does it mean, </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:19:08] yeah, you definitely don't want to remark it to somebody in the market for funerals. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:12] No, exactly. That's that's, it would be awkward. Yeah. and something like Valentine's day or mother's day that you can do that.</p><p>Something that you're after, but for funerals, hopefully that will, yeah. Yeah, that's different </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:19:23] and something I'm, I'm curious about, w H how do you feel about it using, can you create like standardized personas in Google analytics? And do you think it's useful, like Heisenberg or I just opened it a Myers Briggs types indicators, things like that.</p><p>What's your opinion about that? </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:19:40] sure. You can create very detailed segments of the types of users that you're looking for in Google analytics. You can, if you have a three 60 version or something, you can upload a lot of that data back in. if you're doing it in, data warehouse and big query, something like that.</p><p>but I think it's the application of those segments. That's the really important thing. So what are you actually using them for besides just the analysis of your data? How can you be a little bit more proactive? With those segments of data. I think, personalization, when it comes to AB testing solutions, you can share those same segments from Google analytics, into Google optimize, for example, and then personalized towards a persona that you've built out.</p><p>I think personas can also be really useful, not just in your online, analysis and marketing, but also in your product development, right? Understanding that data that you have, and then using that to help guide. How to make a better product for various personas. yes, I think you can do it.</p><p>I think it's the application of what you're using that for. That's more important there. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:34] I think that's a big change for a lot of customers trying to figure out which segments. Makes sense as a psych, as a psychologist, I have an opinion on my opinion. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:20:44] No, but, yeah, but the idea behind the question was, a lot of companies don't actually have a persona of their customers, they segmented in like small or big or, but not really focused on interest or something. So they usually refer to standardized, personas </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:59] in that way. So you want to get away right? Or other way run, but really data driven way to create personas. Based on Google analytics data, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:21:06] for example. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:07] Yeah, that would be nice.</p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:21:09] It would be nice. I think it's only one part of the input, right? So much of persona building is around the qualitative input. can you do some of that with Google analytics? can you get your qualitative data into GA? Yeah, you can. there's many ways of doing that. I, Google surveys is a great option.</p><p>they're working on some cool stuff there, but. I think it's all of the inputs that go into it. And your quantitative web analytics data is only one part of what a person. Yeah. And I can be. Yeah. I let a year ago persona segmentation project when I was at Google actually. And the GA data certainly was a big input, but.</p><p>It was very much paired with a lot of qualitative, input, both in terms of survey data and diary studies. And then there was some log file analysis and in Google analytics data, and all of that helped us put together who our personas were, based on, a lot of different aspects and that then helped us to build the next iteration of Google analytics.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:22:02] Yeah. And then again, it can be, there are a lot of situational. Aspects again, like again with, example of the flowers, you can target me as a persona, but if I'm buying for someone else, there's some, of course there might be something that are, that can be helpful in a way I buy things, but that might be helpful.</p><p>but still there might be a different situations where someone is in our, I also see a little, usually a lot of. a big difference between people's shopping during working hours or outside of that, or, weekday, weekends, personas is probably the same, but they act </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:22:34] differently. Yeah. But there a generalization, We accepted it's a model and a model was never accurate, but, I think it could help, companies who are just starting out, basically trying to use their data in some way. maybe even after doing the first ever check, if data's actually being collected. to start out and to try and understand what you can do with it and maybe advance from there.</p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:22:56] Yeah. And I think, a really cool opportunity maybe for Google's to start thinking along those lines, when it comes to their intelligence, tool set, they're building it to Google analytics, right? The insights cards, the intelligence, can we. Intelligently, tell you about, a unique segment that we found and how that behavior differs from others and, help build those out into personas.</p><p>so I'm happy to pass that along </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:16] to the team. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:23:17] yeah, no, but it would be awesome if then, and then for Google sake, if you then can connect it to Google ads, basically the analytics is telling you which segment is a highly profitable. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:29] that's the whole reason Google is exist is because of Google AdWords.</p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:23:32] yeah, no, but if Google can, more or less automated or, more specifically do it in the outliers. Yeah. That would be helpful, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:40] but got analytics insights also, already, partially doing that. looking at segments, notifying you of weird behavior. </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:23:47] It's getting better. It's a, it's a multiyear project to really build that out into something that's very useful.</p><p>But, even I, myself am surprised sometimes by the really interesting insights that I'm starting to get there. and I know it's only gonna get better. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:01] Those are great insights, right? Whether you're doing a qualitative or quantitative research, if you think, </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:24:06] yeah. Actually the PM or the insights product actually just pinged me last night about some new stuff that they've got coming down the pipe.</p><p>So I'm pretty excited for that to come out. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:14] Cool. Cool. thank you so much. and anything, where do you get your inspiration from? Work-wise? </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:24:21] I've got a really great group of friends that are in the analytics, digital, marketing space. And I get a lot of inspiration from them, from just hanging out from being at conferences and networking.</p><p>From reading a lot of the new stuff coming out. I think there's some really prolific bloggers in our industry and I get a lot of inspiration from that. yeah, I think there's a lot of places to get that inspiration, I think, it's what you actually do with it. and how you turn that around into.</p><p>a blog post or something, social outreach or a business idea, is really the important thing to take away there. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:53] Yeah. So friends in the industry, husbands in industry, both guys do you guys talk about something differently at home or it's mainly </p><p>Krista Seiden: [00:25:03] every once in a while he's okay, we're going to have a Google analytics session.</p><p>‍</p>",,130e1e3f

Can you introduce yourself a bit? And of course, how did you end up working in CROS </p><p>Andrea: [00:00:08] of course.</p><p>So I'm Italian and I started working in Paddy Power Betfair in the gaming team. Basically what we were doing was like bonuses, slots. and I was managing a lot of the database queries, promotions calculation, this kind of stuff. but I always had a passion for UI, UX. Coding. I developed some apps on Android as well, so I had this opportunity to move to Dublin, and joining their, CRO team.</p><p>Basically, it was like a small team. but it was definitely quite interesting for me. So I decided to take the leap and I moved to Dublin from, from Rome. I worked there for like one year, and then I moved to London in the Bedford office. And I kept doing CRO basically. and then I basically decided to move to ITEC and I've been there for like three years, managing their end to end process, basically for optimization.</p><p>And now I manage a team of five that are doing basically optimization the whole day. Okay. </p><p>Guido: [00:01:11] And so what did you learn from the, from the gambling industry? I think that's quite interesting. also socially, the social interaction there and, and the, how, the, how people interact</p><p>Andrea: [00:01:20] I definitely, that's a lot.</p><p>it was actually. A very good qexperience because the Italian business was set up as a startup. So I get basically to learn from insights team. I'm an engineer. I study engineering, so there was a lot of nice like insights based on like you can imagine how much data you can collect in like a bookmaker, all the spins, all the interaction with the games, all the promotions, marketing.</p><p>There was like multiple channels. There was like. Full of data and for a person like me that was like insane. I really loved it. but I always wanted to make changes to the product. You know, when you, when you're there, you see, Oh, actually we could do this differently. And I had no power to have an impact on that.</p><p>This is why then moving into a zero position, it was like a dream come true because then I could start influencing roadmaps or stuff to prove that actually we might have. I bet they use that experience and that will lead to better results or better conversion rates or more revenue. Basic-ally. </p><p>I </p><p>Guido: [00:02:21] also, always found it interesting to visit Magento conferences in Vegas and being in those kinds of areas where there's a little of gambling. it's always really interesting how they also pay a lot of attention to are the building is set up, that are really hard to find an exit, for example, are they arrange all the gambling machines </p><p>Andrea: [00:02:44] to maximize, and I think actually you're right there.</p><p>The biggest learning that was very important. The start of my career was to start thinking about the psychology of the customer. and you need to really think with, with the brain or see things with their eyes because sometimes you might want to, make a change that actually just looks better, but it's not functional for the way they interpret gambling.</p><p>And you have no idea how many tests. In the beginning I was actually failing just because of that. But then when you start tweaking your mindset, then you start actually becoming closer to the user. Is there, when you start seeing, like when the saw you start seeing, like shifting the needle in terms of metrics. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:03:24] So I know at the iTech you have a team of five, so how does CRO at iTech look like? </p><p>Andrea: [00:03:30] Yes. So, basically I decided to move to iTech because I think he's a heavily CRO focused company. basically when I joined iTech, there was a team, a smaller team. the company was smaller because it's, it's a young company and it's still growing.</p><p>And we were working as, I would say, like a typical setup. I'm not gonna get lost too much in the jargon, but basically we had a team that was responsible for AB testing and every request or every test that. What's supposed to be run in the company, was our remit basically. and then as the company grows, as the products grow, then you start feeling the need for change or structural structural change.</p><p>and this is why we moved from, I would say, like a centralized center of excellence. just because we used to be the go to people in the business for every change in the product, or we used to act more like as a consultant sometimes, with product managers, sort of the people in the business just asking for feedback or they wanted to get an idea implemented.</p><p>And, we were basically just helping them. so we moved from this type of setup to, an agile type of setup. so we inspired ourselves a bit to the Spotify model, even though it's not a copy and paste, because that will definitely not work. and now we have experimentation chapters. Embedded in each of the squads that we have within the company.</p><p>So it's a big change and it's still, in ongoing, the idea is to get probably by the next year into an Abrey model, where are we going to have center of excellence? So people with high expertise in conversion rate optimization and the entire company, so each other shop, they're doing their experiments and we just work support them as consultants.</p><p>So, more or less the the idea. So at the moment, we, I would say halfway through. </p><p>Guido: [00:05:24] A lot of companies you say work with, a centralized, </p><p>Structure</p><p>team of experts, </p><p>they would go to for everything, surrounding the experiments. So why do most companies end up doing that?</p><p>Andrea: [00:05:39] You think. well, the centralized structure is very effective, especially when you are like small company. you basically have everything you need within the same team. Communication is great by default, because it's a small team and you always basically are next to each other the whole day, which is great from a zero point of view.</p><p>But then as soon as you start growing, you lose contact with product because then teams start to grow. So this shift up, I would say it's almost necessary most of the times from my experience, just because you need to be closer to the product, which means to be closer to the user, which means to be closer to the end goal, which is improving metrics.</p><p>so yeah, that's, that's, that's my take. There are pros and cons in everything. what I can tell you is that. You lose a bit of space of base, when, when you migrate to a decentralized structure because, an idea that we will build or design in, I dunno, say a week and it might take two or three weeks now because you start having sprints because of the agile framework, because you start having four or five different chapters involved in the process and every step you are into the, into the workplace, obviously slowing you down.</p><p>on the other end, quality usually goes up and that's a bit more structure in what you do. So you end up with, I would say less what, what happens when you have like, centralized structure. Sometimes it's that you start pushing stuff to the side. Then each time you use maybe different designers. So the design is not consistent or the coding standards or guidelines are different because he used several contractors.</p><p>when you're moving from a decentralized structure, it's way more consistent. So it's more future proof in that sense. </p><p>Guido: [00:07:20] Okay. So, but, but that, I guess that depends also on the, how you're, how you are decentralized. If you're a centralized model and you have that designer in house , in that small centralized team, then , that can be fine.</p><p>Andrea: [00:07:34] Yes, but it's true. But the only, the only, obviously it depends on the company where you are and the setup. but I guess if you have a product team and then you have a decent realized CRO team, inconsistency is, might still happen. Because if you, in a decentralized team, even if you have a design that there might be other two or three designers working.</p><p>In say an agile way and the product team. And there might be, you know, a lack of communication in that sense. So this might still lead to differences in other know, like the, the brand guidelines that they use or assets or in my actually do pick up the work as well. It's not effective in that sense or efficient.</p><p>Guido: [00:08:16] Yeah. But then if you decentralize it more and more people get involved, I would expect the communication to become harder. It is consistency to become a harder , </p><p>Andrea: [00:08:24] it is. It is , I mean, consistency to me in my experience, obviously this all depends on, on the, on the company. I think consistency for us went better.</p><p>way better. I will say even like the QA in general is, is, is a bit easier. but the process itself gets slower because the communication gets slower because there's more people involved. </p><p>Guido: [00:08:43] Okay. And so if, if you go to a new company, a new company asks you guys to come in and work with them, do you always advise them to go for decentralized model or the Spotify model or does it also depend on the company?</p><p>Andrea: [00:08:58] The best model. It depends on the level of maturity for servo and these are all program. it depends on the type of expertise that you have in the business. Usually if you want to get low hanging fruits and you want to be as quick as you can to push changes, live and test stuff, probably the centralized model is the quickest way to achieve the result.</p><p>If you then start. Working a bit more structure way on, there's a lot of stakeholders involved, probably with the decentralized, type of structure. It might be helpful to achieve by the results. </p><p>Guido: [00:09:34] Okay. And so, and, and will tell us something about the type of company that does, you said the maturity of the company.</p><p>So how do you guys. Measure that's , that that maturity. How do you go in and sit and decide if you go for centralized or decentralized? </p><p>Andrea: [00:09:49] well, iThink media, even though it seams like an agency, it works with just on. client. So we basically manage the, end to end process for those products, which means that it's not like a typical agency type of work.</p><p>So we don't, we don't get to make this choice basically, if that makes sense. so imagine like you all, I don't know, like hundred sites and you optimize them, and to end. So in that case, it's not like a choice of, okay, which model do I apply in general? If I was working for a typical standard agency.</p><p>I will definitely, look at the structure, have a chat with their teams and try to understand which mother will do the best job. Just to give an understanding, say Paddy power. Betfair we used to work in a centralized way. but then it shifted normally towards a decentralized one. And this, just because when you have.</p><p>mature teams, it will just get national because there's too many other stakeholders have projects involved that you need to embed the experimentation within the squads within the team. Otherwise, this is going to be like clashing between the CRR activity on the products. Unless you are very good at keeping obviously communication and everybody aligned . </p><p>Guido: [00:11:02] so what are the biggest challenges that you see when going from that, a centralized to decentralized on the, on the client side, what, what are their biggest challenges on doing this? </p><p>Andrea: [00:11:11] well, first of all, you need to start, with the imaginization of &nbsp;CRO, and you need to get everybody. In squads.</p><p>I'm basically happy and excited about experimentation, and this is sometimes a long process until you're work in a centralized way. Everybody's aware of what experimentation is, why you need to run experiments and how to do it, but then when you start doing this at the squad level or a tribe level or a company wide level, then you need people to understand experimentation.</p><p>And it's a process that takes time to get everybody. to the same level, a lot of very good level of experimentation. Knowledge. </p><p>Guido: [00:11:50] do you guys have like, exercises for people involved or, or how do you approach this. </p><p>Andrea: [00:11:57] First of all, we, we now try to involve everybody since day one. When there is a project that involves a B testing, being in squads, that's actually, a very, I would say, easier than when you work in a centralized model.</p><p>so we try to get everybody involved since, since the first steps. And this helps in getting their buy in or getting their, their ideas or the feedback on stuff. And we try to work as much as we can as a one single entity though. What's every project experimentation included? so by that, it's a continuous stream of activities that we try to put in place to make sure that everybody knows about experimentation.</p><p>And my take is that you need to, take a different approach depending on the chapter, say developers, if you have to talk to frontend developers about experimentation, you need to tailor. The communication to that you're talking to because they're all interested in different aspects of the experimentation activity.</p><p>So you need to to be more effective, I would say. You need to treat them as obviously separate entities and then get everybody up to speed with the experimentation program. </p><p>Guido: [00:13:08] Okay. So basically you need to do personalization, but internally for the people that you work with. </p><p>Andrea: [00:13:13] Exactly. </p><p>Guido: [00:13:14] Okay. So are there. Any things that you see that continuously need effort in this?</p><p>I mean you go and do this transition from a centralized, decentralized, hopefully you get everyone trained and used to working like that, but are there things that continuously needs efforts, to keep this rolling? </p><p>Andrea: [00:13:34] Yes. well, first of all, the sharing learnings is something that helps in keeping everybody hooked to the experimentation.</p><p>train, because when you see results of your job, you get purpose of, of what you do and why. AB testing is, is very important. also, being, I would say cutting edge in as much as you can, obviously in the activities that you do is important as well, because it excites people, and what they do.</p><p>So for instance, we. We are now migrating most of the products to server side testing. And this is something that for developers was very important. It improved a lot. Their workflow. it's way more interesting from a coding perspective gives them more flexibility. and this is something that helps same way the sinus.</p><p>Like when you start working on projects that are more interesting or they involve like the latest trends and stuff, you will obviously get them. More interested in the experimentation activity. It's, it's, that's, that's a lot of things that you need to keep up and put in place. But at the end of the day, like what we really want to share is I, everybody thinks experimentation and, and this is, this is all.</p><p>Guido: [00:14:49] Okay, nice. And, looking forward, what are the things you guys are working on for the next 12 months? What are you looking for to, to change or optimize? What are you working on right now? </p><p>Andrea: [00:15:00] so yeah, as I mentioned, we are migrating, most of the sites, at least the most important ones though, are server site testing, which is an interesting project.</p><p>and then I will say for </p><p>Guido: [00:15:10] us as an </p><p>Andrea: [00:15:12] interesting project because, you know, when you go service side, there's a lot of backend, involved and we have multiple. West side websites are multiple CDN. So everything, every site basically has a different setup. So there's a lot of people involved. It's, send interesting project.</p><p>There's a lot to learn from that. and then I will say the usage of data is something that we need to improve. because again, when you go to into a decentralized model, then you need more or less everybody to think in an experimentation way. So using the data, both qualitative and quantitative. The type of research that you have to come up with ideas and analyze test.</p><p>So this is something that I really hope that in the next 12 months will improve. So it will get us closer to the hybrid model that we want to achieve. And that's, I think that's pretty much the top two points that. And obviously more tests,</p><p>Guido: [00:16:09] but how do you do this? how do you unlock the data? What kind of tools do you, do you use that everyone in the company has insights in customer behavior. </p><p>Andrea: [00:16:18] Yes. So first of all, you need to make the tools accessible to everybody. And this is something that we already did so everybody can access the data.</p><p>But then you need to train people and you need to, try to explain to them what's the most effective way to use the data. Because if you are a data savvy person, you, you might even want to spend one hour in front of your, of your laptop or more to just drill, drilling down to the data and trying to fund what you, what you're looking for by, if you are.</p><p>A chapter that is a bit more, let's say, less data savvy or you're not that interested into digging into the data, then you need to provide them with the right infrastructure to get what they want in a quick way. And this is why building the right dashboards, so telling them exactly what to find and where to find it.</p><p>It's very, it's very important because they will learn this way and they will get more hungry for data. the, the more they use it basically. </p><p>Guido: [00:17:14] Yeah. Are there any tools you use for this? </p><p>Andrea: [00:17:17] Yes. Yeah, we, we, we use session, come for visitor recordings. We use Adobe analytics, for the analytics. But then we got a lot of like other data that comes from our database and the rest of it.</p><p>So we are trying to join basically all the data sources and to manipulate the data so that it will be easily accessible for </p><p>Guido: [00:17:35] everybody. thanks so much for sharing all of this with us, Andrea. so my final question for you, do you have any, any tips on books that you'd like to tip to our audience </p><p>Andrea: [00:17:44] so there's a couple of books that I, one, actually it's almost done, I've read it, but that's a new one that I got recently is called experimentation works from Stefan Thomke. </p><p>Guido: [00:17:55] Let me see Experimentation Works. This one. </p><p>Andrea: [00:18:00] That's it. </p><p>Guido: [00:18:02] There we go. Fanboys. Yes. </p><p>Andrea: [00:18:03] And then there's another one that I almost read it all, which is from Georgi Georgiev, it's called statistical methods for online AB testing.</p><p>And it's quite &nbsp;interesting because I. Like when I started, there was not much about the online, about the, the way you can analyze a B test. So I got really interested in that and doing a lot of research and stuff. But then this book came out and it's a very good book to start learning more about the statistics behind the AB testing.</p><p>Guido: [00:18:34] So it probably has a chapter of Frequentist versus Bayesian. </p><p>Andrea: [00:18:38] yes, that's a lot of stuff. Very interesting. </p><p>Guido: [00:18:44] Cool. Well, thanks so much for sharing. We will, we'll definitely add those books in the show notes. So anyone can find them. thanks so much. &nbsp;Good luck with, well you're doing and helping your clients with, the, the tradition and staying, staying the course.</p><p>talk to you soon. Bye. Bye. </p><p>‍</p>",,5a72bfe0

There's only. The meat for the insights team, which covers both zero and weapon analytics and dunky is a senior technical analyst with a background in philosophy. My name is Peter Yalta and welcome the award winning podcast, where I show you the behind the scenes of optimization teams.</p><p>I've talked with their specialists about data and human driven optimization, and implementing a culture of experimentation and validation. In case you missed it in the previous English episodes we spoke with &nbsp;mail about the six soft skills that you, as a hero needs to master, you can listen to the episode on Ciroc fair website or in the podcast right now.</p><p>Now, before we start, you just heard me saying something about award winning, both guests. last week was the first edition of the experimentation culture awards. And I'm honored to have been announced as the winner for the individual category for evangelizing zero in general NCRO culture. In particular </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:01:12] with </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:13] the Ciroc fate podcast, I was already surprised to be nominated, to be honest, for the top five.</p><p>So you can imagine my surprise when they announced me actually winning the award. So a big, thank you goes out to the organization and the jury of the awards. I'm honored to be able to reach so many people in our industry each week through this both guys. And I love how it not only shows the big, awesome things that we all do also gives a voice to the more introverted people and the mundane stories of everyday Ciro.</p><p>The depth of knowledge and the amazing stories of all my guests keeps surprising me and not infrequently. These are stories from people that don't necessarily want to go on stage or write a long blog post or record a video of themselves, but they are comfortable with doing it. And just a normal one on one conversation with a Federalist zero practitioner who knows about the struggles.</p><p>And just happens to have a big record, but, and a microphone. And they are able to share this with us all and spread their knowledge for us all to enjoy. So despite this being an individual award, I really feel that we won. This is a Testament to the openness of all my guests in the past two years. That's often for the first time share their story with the world.</p><p>It's been my honor to be your host and I will definitely continue doing so, but it's the stories of my guests that make the podcast. And this is also for you as a listener of the podcast. You always want to know more. You want to keep learning and you're open to change, changing your mind, changing your way of working.</p><p>And I love that, that you help. Keeping, keeping me growing this community. Thank you all for that. Now let's get started with this episode of shearography, which again is made possible by our partners online dialog. SiteSpect online influence institutes, content square, and comfort.com. Welcome to season two, episode 39.</p><p>These online dunky welcome to the zero cafe. And of course, we'd like to start with getting to know you guys a bit better. So let's start with a designer. could you tell us a bit more about what you do as a </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:03:10] depth? yeah, so I am the team lead of the insights team at depths, and that is the team that does both Shiro, but also a lot of weapon analysis and, to get it with my colleagues, I work for.</p><p>Pretty wide variety of clients. So a lot of B to C re eCommerce platforms, but also more traditional B2B, and everything in between. Okay. So that's </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:34] yeah. Is there a specific niche that this aiming for, or an extra, you have very broad range of clients, but is there a specific niche or something that you end up with having as a client?</p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:03:45] No. No, not really. I think, I think. The cool thing of working, especially in this Euro team is that we have this wide variety. my typical day is consists out of, doing very Beatsy focused lines first, and then I'll move over to something very specific needs to be with like a very long customer journey or very complex, services or products.</p><p>So I think that makes it cool to work there as well. To have that variety or, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:13] okay. And then a technical analyst that does that mean you have to fix all the mess, that, that the clients made. Yeah. </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:04:19] Yeah. It's definitely, it's interesting though, because. I tend to look at my job as a, on the one hand, very technical</p><p>the first time, that kind of stuff. Usually what you end up talking </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:36] about, </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:04:37] how are we going to, Hey, within your organization, build a process around it has the proper governance who's </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:46] can publish to know more stuff. You want to </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:04:48] keep? Yeah. It's all technical on one side.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:55] that you help? </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:04:56] Yeah. You say it like that, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:58] challenge the challenges </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:05:00] with the clients. Yeah, definitely. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:03] What are we saying? And if you have four new clients, what are the most, common technical issues or technical things that you need to do first before you can actually start doing four foot before Lisa can do her work?</p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:05:14] So it's actually, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:17] what </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:05:17] I see most is just to start with an understanding, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:21] let's start with what is it that we actually want to do? </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:05:24] What is it that we actually want to measure that we want to experiment with? So really getting that down and getting all stakeholders aligned within an organization to say, okay, this is our.</p><p>Goal. this is the goal that we can agree a got agree upon together, and then start building out the solutions and picking the right tools for the job and the right budget for that. That's really, one of the most common challenges in terms of organization. in terms of practical challenges, I would say, just getting rid of it, the legacy, that usually, especially if you look in, tech management containers, for example, we'll find like 200 different tags and, like 150 of them are not used, are not like put in optimally.</p><p>so they'll just, they, it's an interesting test. I did this at a client once where. we just removed 150 of these tags and then looked at the difference in speed, for the actual end user. and we shaved off about three to four seconds. So that was an interesting test in of itself </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:30] as a relatively easy fix.</p><p>Yeah. that's nice. that's interesting. Yeah. and, yeah, of course, when we talk about zero and, and technical side of things, there are quite, quite some things happening. last couple of, Months, it last couple of years is the move away from using cookies for this.</p><p>so at least on the houses impacting basically your </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:06:50] whole work. Yeah. It does quite a </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:51] lot extra. And can you still do your work? </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:06:53] the is, this is a very tricky thing, you can do your work and you can look at the data. You can run your AB test and not notice there was anything going on.</p><p>you, if you would not know that there is an issue with cookies, you would just. No, I'll make your analysis and, think you're doing the right thing. but actually you're looking partly at, invalid data. yes, you can still do your work, but at this point, without having, the proper solutions in place, it does take a lot of, fixes to get the right data.</p><p>yeah, to get the right data in place. So one thing is, for example, in our analysis, we always look at, what the, number of sessions are that people have to have before they convert, or the number of days before people convert. Obviously when you look at those type of reports, nowadays, those yeah.</p><p>Will consist out of invalid data. And again, that depends a bit upon your clients. As I mentioned, we have a pretty wide variety of clients. What I see in traditional, business to business, that there's a complete different set of browsers that are being used a lot of Chrome, for example, where this issue isn't taking place just yet.</p><p>but we also have clients that sell, for example, Apple accessories. So obviously you have a lot of Safari traffic there, and. Especially for those clients. We see that those reports are missing more and more data basically. And that's just the analysis part of things. Yeah. And of course you have your EBT.</p><p>this point for many of my clients, I recommend too. Not room tests for longer than a week, which means that you have very little data to work with. or yeah, she do want to expand your runtime that it has to look at too. Yeah. But I was just like Chrome and, more or less a of Chrome users are also representative for a Safari or Mozilla Firefox users.</p><p>So yeah, it does take a lot of, fixers and double checking things. to make sure that you're looking at actual balance data, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:49] marketing merges have suffers. And the sh here for AB testing has been impacted too. If you want to keep that thing to enterprise standards, but save 80% on your annual contract, you can consider comfort.</p><p>But their summer release, you can take advantage of full stack and hybrid features, strong privacy compliance, no blink and enterprise. Great security. Feel good about your smart business position in what you saved back your CRO program. Check out www adult's overtook slash 2020. And then key in case people are listening.</p><p>I hope not, but, in case people are listening and now thinking shit, say what happened, what is happening? Why are brothers? </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:09:36] Yeah, so it really, I think it's down to two parts. So we've seen the sort of a legislative part, We've seen the GDPR, and the EU trying to limit it. The amount of tracking that's happening online.</p><p>So it used to be the case that it was really easy for any kind of app platform to set up. Yeah. A cookie. so Facebook could consider a cookie when they're on your website, they could set a cookie on the Facebook with domain. And that means that, you can, it can be tracked across all other sites that are also using the Facebook library and setting cookies on the Facebook domain.</p><p>then we have the EU saying, okay, that's not really what we want for our citizens. let's do something about that, but it just went on and I think Apple has done. And really they've been the leader on this weather, because they think it's a good cause or bit because they think it's gives them a competitive edge.</p><p>We don't know. But in any case, they took up the support for their users and said, Hey, this is not where we want for our users. We're going to protect our users from. These practices. and they started the intelligent tracking prevention it's been going on for a few years, but in the last year they really doubled down on it and said this whole third party cookie thing.</p><p>We're just gonna walk third party cookies all together. so no retargeting, no remarketing. and also as a sort of collateral damage, you could say, the first party cookies and any kind of browser storage was impact really. So that meant that, The identification that you could store for a user with their, either the advertisement and that they clicked on, for example, but also like a login credentials.</p><p>And that kind of stuff was limited to, one day, if you were coming from an advertisement or seven days, if you're coming, if you're not coming from an advertising, but directly to the site. And what is that. This has been a really big step in, what you can actually do in terms of attributing conversion, in setting, assigning experiments to users and keeping them within that same experiment.</p><p>So this is what Lisa was talking about. If you don't know that this is going on, it means that the same user can return within say a week or two weeks. and they can get assigned different experiments, right? they can do the B on both sides of the AB test. So yeah, Safari is taking up the lead to prevent their users being tracked and you see it, that other browsers are following suit as well.</p><p>So let's say the Firefox, Microsoft edge has been really, mostly blocking third party cookies. and that slowly Chrome is also following suit. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:14] so sorry, at least on that in my mind, there will be. Two, two main ways of dealing this, one would be, trying to figure out a way to, to supply it to move away from cookies, but replaced it with something else.</p><p>So we can still track users for the length that cookies, would give us or the other route would be. Okay. We need to change the way we do experiments at all. So we need to do that within the boundaries, the new boundaries that we have, which way are we going? </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:12:44] I think it's too early to really call any, any conclusions just yet.</p><p>we see that this has been happening for especially the last couple of months and a lot of solutions are being thought of, but I don't think we have a finished list just yet of, the solutions that we have. But I think it's, I think it's important to make a distinction here. So first of all, you have the short term tactics, right?</p><p>Just things you can do more in a short term to deal with this situation. So those are things that, for example, entails scoop surface tagging. that is something that you can work on, but I think. implementing that you had at the same time, asked to look at, longterm strategy because in the end you can do service sites tagging.</p><p>And of course we'll fix some things, but you will have to, work through a more sustainable solution here. And I think when we talk about a sustainable solution is really about. yeah, building a more direct relationship, basically with your visitors and with your customer. meaning acquire more first body data.</p><p>And I think that's really, something that we should all focus on. sourceful acquiring the data. creating more or less incentives for people to identify who they are, and that can be done via a login. I think that makes most sense for a lot of, platforms, but also white paper downloads or, any other way that you can, for example, get an email address and, Keep on recognizing people when they come back later on, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:09] is it called Schumer?</p><p>We can expect more and more websites where the first page is a long. </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:14:14] Yeah, definitely. you're already seeing that, look at, when you go to read something on medium.com, for example, that is like hover over it that says, Oh, you want to look at login with your Google account, click here.</p><p>It's really easy. that's really the kind of stuff that I think we'll start to see as well as incentive based. login. log in, sign up for our newsletter to get a 10% discount. That kind of stuff. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:35] Was I getting more and more used to this a bit, by using more and more apps and for most apps you need to log in anyway.</p><p>but just still can be. Can be annoying if you just go to a new service or for, to, for example, just want to read something, a medium, click on the, on Twitter, go to medium and then your fourth. </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:14:54] Yeah, definitely. And I think that's also a conversation that, we should have as consultants. There's also as a.</p><p>As a company, it's all about having the right skills, right? So this is also, I think what you mentioned that, of course, as an eCommerce platform, you want to sell things, but you also want to remarket people. So the first and main objective there is of course, to sell your products, for example, and.</p><p>trying or persuading people to, get them to log in, really requires you to think of, Hey, what added value can we offer for our clients and our visitors for them to actually give their data. I think it's takes. If your inquiry is actually us to better think about the added value for our customers.</p><p>what can we do in terms of shipment costs or in terms of, in the distance, this counts goes, for example. so it's Instead of just using a cookie that we can implement really easily with a snippet and just throw it out there. It's brings back the responsibility to us as marketeers as well, to better think about what are we offering our clients and how can we.</p><p>Ask them to give out their data. So only one hands respecting them as well, if they decide not to do that. setting that cookie down anyways, but on the other hand, if they decided to give their data to you as a company, to make sure that you really, add value for them </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:14] in that sense. online is starting to look more and more like the traditional, offline marketing.</p><p>The, we actually need to build a relationship with that. </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:16:21] Yeah. Horribly. Yeah, </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:16:22] no. Yeah. But I think so. Yeah. And that is the difficult challenge because as you were saying, it's on a it's you can focus on these short term tactics and talk about stuff like service start tagging, or, there's all these kinds of solutions that will help you extend your cookie lifestyle, that kind of stuff.</p><p>But it's really about. Getting all these people within your organization together, right? The marketeers, the online Mark, offline marketeers, the designers, someone with a user experience, background, and start to think about it. What is actually the journey that the user goes through and how can we add value in such a way that there is a kind of exchange where, they give up, their email address or their phone number in exchange for added value.</p><p>so that we are able to identify them properly across channels. Yeah. </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:17:09] And I think it needs to add a bit on to that. Is that. Traditionally, we were used to look at cookies and also, therefore we were used to look at a very channel specific approach, right? you'd look at your, your ads, words, ads, or your Facebook ads or whatever.</p><p>And I think now also, taking that first party data as a starting Fornes the quarter shoots really look from the customer point of view. So looking at that. journey and third touch ones and shifting the focus from a more general, final approach or a, platform approach to really the journey and how you can help them as very specific points to, to get the information that they're looking for, or find the product that they need.</p><p>So it's really about you focus. And I think in that sense for us as marketeers to really do a better job. </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:17:56] as well as a challenge, because how are you gonna, how are you going to test this right. Yeah. How are you going to test it across all these channels and make sure that someone stays within the same experiment?</p><p>that's, I think that's going to be really difficult. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:11] Logged in, </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:18:12] would make our life so much easier. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:15] For over 10 years now. Oh my God. Look at Pfizer's about evidence based conversion optimization with a focus on data and psychology. We see that analyzing data and recognizing customer behavior results in a better online dialogue with your clients and a higher ROI that team of strategists, analysts, psychologists, and UX specialists gathered valuable insights in your online behavior of your visitors and together with you optimize them elements of your zero program through redesign expert reviews, AB test and behavioral analysis.</p><p>For more information about their services, go to Owen dialogue. Look. For the people listening to this, and maybe I have a lot of, tools they're using right now. for example, a whole jar, that we just mentioned. So is that. Can we just throw them all away or, is there still a use case to keep using those tools or do we need to look for alternatives surface side alternatives?</p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:19:08] It's still far, especially tools like culture. They're still very much interesting to use. So I think we need to make a distinction here between analytical tools, such as for jar, where you want your heat maps and your user recordings. And they're all pretty much. Session based or even page based. So it doesn't really matter that you're not able to recognize use as off through a week again, especially for dose analytical purposes.</p><p>However, I think every time you want to start doing a personalization in Google apps and wash for example, or run an AB test in a visual website, optimizer that's where, your alarm bells or alarm bells should go off. Yeah, plus they are indeed you will have an issue recognizing Safari users or Firefox users off through a week.</p><p>So you don't have to throw them out. You just have to, for now, as long as you don't have any solutions in place, take into consideration that you're no longer able to recognize them. And that's a meantime, also work on, some fixes, for example, like a service site tagging or resetting the QV surface sites.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:09] and you already mentioned that if you don't know. that this is an issue to begin with. you might not notice this. Maybe you noticed this, the specific segments, like Safari are becoming less and less prevalent in your analytics. so less and less users. but it might not be obviously quite obvious why this is happening.</p><p>So is there a way to figure out how much of your traffic is affected by this? </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:20:35] Yeah, definitely. </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:20:35] So there is, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:38] I feel </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:20:40] it's taken away. </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:20:41] Yeah. I think what's interesting is before we start to think about what's actually impacted, just think about the things that you as a user can do and how that potentially can impact the way your analytics store or CRO tool is tracking you.</p><p>So we're not coming from an ideal world. Either right, because it's not just about these cookies. It's about, think about your opening, an email on your phone in say the Gmail app that opens. If you click a link on that, it opens in a browser within the Gmail app. Then you're like, Hey, I don't want to open this in the Jima app because I'm not locked in here.</p><p>Sorry, click on the Safari, about, when I go to the Safari app and there I'm currently logged in, so those already are two difference users that you're tracking two different sessions that have started and it's. Actually the same user that you're tracking. And then on top of that, because you're going to that Safari app, your story, the cookie there for seven days.</p><p>if I return after seven days following that same link, again, a new user and that's the. the things that we need to think about, we need to think about actually human behavior. And what does it look like and how is it going to impact our tracking and our analytics? When you consider that, then you need to think about it.</p><p>Okay. what's going to be the actual impact on my users and you then really need to look at session based information because that's all you have. So you can look at, how many Safari users do I have? How many, Firefox users do I have? and I've seen these tools where, people have been looking at, Oh, these many people are still using an older Safari browser, so you can track them in the oldest society browser.</p><p>And I would say, just assume that, within the next year, six to 12 months, every month is going to update or at least 90 days. 95% is going to update to, a version of a browser that's going to limit, the tracking capabilities. so yeah, looking at that. You can really see that if you're the number of Safari users and the number of Firefox users that you're are visiting your site, when it's really high, you really need to consider like the sort of action and implication that has for you right away.</p><p>If the number of Chrome users is a little bit bigger, then you might say, Oh, I have a little bit more time before, over the next 12 to 18. To 24 months when Chrome starts implementing some stuff, I have a little bit more time to actually accommodate for that. So I think that's the sort of calculation that you can do.</p><p>And other than that, it really depends on the business. So for example, is it like a, is it fast moving consumer goods, square people are returning, like every month or so to buy something new or is it a B2B business where, you know, someone like lead times are very long, someone might download a white paper and then they'd discuss it internally, ask for two months and then someone else from the company comes back, and they download a white paper as well.</p><p>And then, Another two months later, they finally contact someone in there sales department and say, Hey, we're actually interested in your product. That's a totally different story than, when someone. Comes back every month or so. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:54] Yeah, exactly. and now do you guys approach us with clients that, where you see this problem popping up, that you see more and more, tracking issues?</p><p>like you said, of course it wasn't a perfect world to begin with, but, the problem starts accumulating. maybe you need to move to a surface science, tracking solution. So how do you approach this? do you do. Make an ROI calculation for this, or how does this go? </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:24:17] it's a really good question.</p><p>Cause we, we haven't figured it out fully. either there is, you could do an ROI calculation, but there's a lot of assumptions in there. Yeah. so it makes. A lot of sense to think about the skill of your organization, the potential impact that and we can make a sort of, investment about what do we think is actually going to cost to implement something like service, our tagging.</p><p>and what is that actually the clients for whom this is interesting are mostly clients where, for example, they have. They have a lot of different countries that they're serving. So are their reach is just very broad. Really. So with one service, our tagging solution, they could serve all these different countries that they have.</p><p>That's a really interesting use case. The other use cases where there's a lot of inputs, for example. So by that, you have say an iOS app, you have an Android app, you have a website, maybe you have, a loyalty card or whatever you have offline stores, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:18] little touch points. Yeah. </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:25:19] Yeah. A lot of different things, spoons that you can put into your.</p><p>Service are taking solution. really that makes it, makes it more interesting. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:26] Okay. So basically you're saying probably the first clients to move over through this, are the clients that already have additional benefits to using service sites even besides, moving to Kirkland's world? </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:25:40] Exactly.</p><p>Yeah. Okay. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:41] Interesting. And are artists specific verticals or other, is it, do you see, for example, eCommerce, parties moving through this faster than others? </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:25:50] Or I would say so. I, the clients that I've been talking with are mostly e-commerce right now, although there are some B2B as well. but again, it depends on the scale and the potential impact, right?</p><p>So usually it's tights. Not only to the bigger sister. So tagging is a solution for a lot of different problems and it brings its own problems with it as well. yes, it does help you to, for example, extend the lifetime of your cookies. but what's more interesting for a lot of parties is that it allows you to, tie a lot of.</p><p>Information to get our server side as well. So for example, for an eCommerce party, you could think of, you have product margins on which products actually have the highest margin, And you definitely don't want your competitors to see those margins, but with a service thinking solution, you could, tie that database of product margins that you have together with the incoming stream of user event data, and then say, Hey, when the product margin is a certain level, I want to send a conversion to this platform, or I want to do something different with this user, give them a certain property, put them in a certain experiment, bucket, that kind of stuff.</p><p>So it does open up a lot of. New, potentially interesting ways of connecting user data with business data </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:27:12] certainly is on the doc, a whole new range of experiments opening up now that you can do more and more service sites. </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:27:19] Yeah, definitely. I think one of the biggest things is that what them keep pointed out is that the situation that we started was.</p><p>With wasn't ideal at first either. of course you weren't able to run experiments for any longer period of time than I'd say three weeks max. and at this point I think, having the ability to reset scoops, for example, from server, enables you to do run tests for a longer period of time. to also for low traffic websites to do run some fast that have.</p><p>less impact or, less effects, but still be able to, to run significant tests. So that is definitely a possibility there. yeah, so that's, that really helps. Yeah, yesterday's brainstorm was so good. </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:28:00] I really liked step's idea </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:28:01] of running that test on the call to action buttons, making them orange will really make them stand out.</p><p>Don't you think? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:09] Yeah, We want to design a real AB test winners and achieve enormous conversion uplift. Then stop, brainstorming, and take a scientific approach. If you can read Dutch, follow the steps, then online input, the best seller on the management book, Dalton out and rule in the office course and become an expert in applying proven behavioral signs.</p><p>Yourself goes to &nbsp;dot com for more information and freedom. Do you also see downsides on surface? If you compare, if you want to run any experiments and you have clients to do a service sides, a first client side, are those sites limitations or does it, for example, take longer to develop those experiments.</p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:28:49] There's a difference here. you don't have to run your full test service shot to be able to reset the cookie surface side. So there are examples, or their stool tooling in place that will reset. For example, your visual website, optimizer cookie, or your Google optimized cookie that allows your cookie to, be in place for a longer period of time.</p><p>Two knots to expire. There are toolings in place that will allow you to reset that cookies server size using your client's sides, a test tool. So using Google optimize or visual website optimizer, and I think that's for a lot of our clients, at least I think the more ideal situ solution in this case.</p><p>you do have. The easy setup, the visual editor, managing your tests easily, but you're able to run your tests for a longer period of time. So I wouldn't necessarily move over to server side testing right away. but half bath client's sides as with, fond, such of setting your cookie server shot.</p><p>I think that will. help out a lot of customers. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:50] Yeah. That sounds like a nice intermediary solution. </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:29:53] yeah. I think so. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:55] Okay. The blah, we're talking about, tools. Are there any new tools people should be looking out for when switching to serve sides? </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:30:02] Yeah. Yeah. the big thing that's provoked this discussion online.</p><p>If you're, if you're in this niche, then you see a lot of bows around this going on. is Google tech manager service side. which has just come out in, in betta. And I think what's interesting with that is it's not necessarily something new. It's just that it's. It's packaged in such an easy way that it's become very easy for people to set up.</p><p>but if you're interested in that, there's been quite a few tools that have been doing this for a lot longer. it's almost like segment, but also, Tealium has been doing this for a while. and in terms of CRO, I'm not actually aware of any, Current tools on that or new tools on that. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:44] Some of the existing tools of course are move, try to move surface side.</p><p>And, SiteSpect is going, as, as always been surface arts. yeah. Okay. tooling, the tooling already, it's mainly the tech manager that you need to look, look after in first place. And then, there are intermediary solutions for your actual testing tools. So if you're already using, for example, if you double the O like you mentioned, you could still be using that.</p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:31:08] Yeah, definitely. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:31:09] There's no direct need to switch. </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:31:10] You asked about the downsides of a surface, like tagging or resetting of cookies. And I think that's one thing that this whole thing started with a privacy of course, and also transparency about the data that you're collecting. And I think that is one important downside of having a service side tagging is that you will lose that transparency, right?</p><p>As you mentioned, when you do it, via traditional GTM, for example, you're able to see what everyone is collecting, in sorts of events and whatnot. however, if you move to our server sides solution, you're no longer a transparent, in a sense about what is the extract data that you're collecting from your user.</p><p>apart from all the practical thing and the practical, implications in terms of Sierra, I think there's also more of a. a principal idea here about, so we do want more privacy and we do want more transparency out wherever the solution for this, trend that we see now is to move their server side solution that kind of loses this transparent, way of working.</p><p>So I think that is an important thing that we have to take into consideration. </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:32:16] Yeah. And you get totally new questions here as well, right? Because it's, we used to not really think about it ad blockers, but, with service site tagging, it becomes a lot easier to circumvent ad blockers as well.</p><p>For example. So to situation that you can have is that someone has opted into your, your marketing cookies and that kind of stuff, but then they're still using an app blocker. And are you gonna, are you gonna honor their. their use of the ad blocker. Are you going to respect that or are you going to say, they UpToDate in any way, so I'm just going to track them.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:32:47] Sounds very familiar to a, of course, when we got all the cookery, legislation, of course it sounds nice in principle, but if everyone's doing it, then all the consumers have to click OK. Every website now. And if you have 99.9% of people doing clicking. Okay. And it defeats the point of.</p><p>Informing people of what actually </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:33:06] yeah. </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:33:06] What's actually happening. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:33:09] We'll see. We'll see how that plays out. So how, so I'm a bit looking into the future or near future at least. what do you, what does it, what are the developments that in this space? And I assume that start with more and more browsers that are double start doing this.</p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:33:24] I think that's indeed the first thing that comes to mind. So Chrome will also, in the near future moves to a more privacy friendly, set up. so I think it's basically about, making sure you have that relationship with your users so that old rails down, I think to acquiring that.</p><p>First party data, making sure that you use those, accounts in self identification to track, but also to, to personalize. So I think apart from doing your AB testing, I think, becoming more personal to your users will be an automatic extension of your AB testing program. Since you now are able to recognize them better.</p><p>And you want to also provide that personal experience throughout their, full journey. and I think we need to become more flexible and shift the way we think about traditional touchpoints, like marketing channels and, also measuring on platforms. So moving from that, very much general focus approach in which you.</p><p>Awesome likes your Facebook ads, but do not look at the landing page for example, or we optimize everything in our Edwards, but, don't have any idea of what the messaging throughout the platform is. I think that will be the key focus for the upcoming months for marketeers to start understanding how they can apply.</p><p>So my stuff's full journey instead of just one specific part of that such warrants </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:34:43] in general, I think that's an issue with, with the level of furor programs at companies, That they're very focused on the website itself, but don't necessarily, across, across touch points. Yeah. In a way of what you mentioned earlier, I think with Chrome, I think it was, in a previous episode, there was a steamer half, as I mentioned.</p><p>yeah, chromosome, there are market leaders. So they're probably the last ones to move, obviously also because it's a Google owned and, or at least directors and, it's not necessarily in their best interests to move in this direction really fast. </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:35:12] Yeah. And at the same time, Google of course has a lot of first party data and themselves, So they're not really losing in the sense. we're also relying more on platforms like Google and Facebook because they do have that data and we need them to, provide us with, for example, data sets of people that are interested in a certain branch or, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:35:31] yeah, I think a Google itself has a lot of.</p><p>it has a lot of that. It's all. But I think more of the users of their platform, like analytics or Edwards. Yeah. if Google switches off to us, switches to two rollers, privacy mounts, all those users rule out issues. Nothing. </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:35:48] What's interesting though, I think is that they are preparing for that. So would you see with Google is that they, they admit that, if they don't have consent for.</p><p>say 30% or 40% of your users, they need to be able to do something with it. Sad, that big part that's unknown. So they are starting to, apply modeling and machine learning to say, Hey, we've had historical data. We've had data maybe from different sides. and we can apply that kind of data for some models to predict what.</p><p>These users would have done if they had given consent. So that's, I think that's really interesting. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:36:25] Yeah. Do you use the data that you have and see if we can use machine learning to, maybe not know exactly, but at least have some ID basically basic understanding of what we. What they would have done or are there any other developments that we should be looking out for </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:36:41] in this area?</p><p>so I think this is actually, it's an indication of the complexity of out's got to only become bigger and bigger, right? So on the one hand, it's going to be a real challenge for small businesses, mostly where they just don't have the. The capacity to deal with that kind of complexity. They don't have.</p><p>The one has to think about now, do I need to model for the users that don't have consented? Do I need to implement service our Tegan at the same time? I think the companies that do have the capacity for that, and are maybe a little bit more tech oriented as well. They really have an advantage to take, two, just take leaps forward here and, yeah, out of their competition in that sense.</p><p>But I think that's. Yeah. Yeah. And that's really the change that we might see in the next year or so where a few companies will take that lead. And, I'm curious to see how much of an impact it will. it will really happen. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:37:36] and hopefully like you, you're started off with hopefully a lot of the websites that are a lot faster because they have less tax on my website.</p><p>That will be nice. </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:37:45] That me, I'm more secure as well because. That's the funny thing, like we, we, accepted is that a system where, or an ecosystem where it's so acceptable to just load in all these JavaScript libraries from third party vendors, whether it's, from a little bit more trusted vendors like Facebook and Google or.</p><p>Any obscure third-party advertising system that you're working with. We're just every one of these libraries is an attack factor for someone to, to use an exploit's. Yes, it </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:38:15] seems sometimes that's why I have this. the extension goes through that. You're probably familiar with. And they can show a pop up with all the things that are lower than my website and some websites.</p><p>It's just insane. Sometimes I have a big screen, but sometimes my screen isn't high enough, all the different things that are being loaded. So that's </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:38:33] and then Ghostery itself is sending. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:38:35] Yeah, exactly. Yeah. That's also a fun factor here. so yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much for enlightening us on, the current state of, the calculus, more and more calculus, world.</p><p>and now we can move to post cookie, a world as zero specialist. final question. I ask almost anyone, any books that you would like to tip to our audience? Which don't necessarily have to be cookie related, but any books on digital analytics or CRO or experimentation or in it, somewhere in that area.</p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:39:04] Good question. I'm not so much of reading books myself. I'm more of a, </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:39:09] the </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:39:10] blogs and like smaller updates that I liked it and </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:39:14] stuff for me. And any blogs you recently or what are the, what are your, Go to blogs for information on this. </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:39:21] Oh, actually, maybe this is a thing for quite a long time that I recently discovered the think with google.com a herb with a lot of knowledge there.</p><p>So I liked that. and apart from that, Let me think we have, let me check my inbox because there's a newsletter that I can definitely recommend for everyone. Let me see. Maybe in the meantime, a dinky, you have some tips as well. </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:39:44] you mentioned somewhere. I have, I think he just does an amazing job at documenting all this stuff.</p><p>So if. If people don't follow him yet, follow him on, on Twitter, on his own blog, on, the measure Slack channel, for example, and he's just, he's everywhere. LinkedIn, he answers all your questions. it's insane. really great guy by the way. And I think in terms of, two sort of books, that area, if you're into.</p><p>more sort of data science for your business. There's a book called data science for business. I have to look up the authors. No to my heart, but, yeah, it's a really great way to think about not only the data science part, but really the business part as well. And that's really my main point in most of the discussions that I have with clients.</p><p>It's where I tell them, it's not just about the tools that you're using. It's not about the yeah. Yeah. th the stuff or the people you have, it's mostly about setting the rides goals, setting, ride, KPIs, understanding your business, understanding the landscape. And that's really where I find, Simon Wardley and, Wardley maps.</p><p>Really interesting. He has a book actually on medium. cold, Wardley mapping. And it really allows you if you're into that kind of stuff to think about this stuff from a business perspective, and think about where your organization is, where you're adding value and how you can move that into the future.</p><p>think about where you're adding value in the future. It's not for everyone, but if you like the business side of stuff, and </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:41:16] so they decided for business, I think that's a, Is that the one, the faucets. Yeah. And the other one, the medium blog, we will link to that one. </p><p>Lisanne Maatman: [00:41:27] I found my newsletter, by the way.</p><p>Yeah. I found it's called Benedict Evans newsletter. So it's, especially when you're interested in things like privacy, everything more from an ethical point of view and really his essays are pretty great. I think it's a good rate. </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:41:41] We'll </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:41:42] add that to the show notes for everyone interested in, And, those, those read those books, they, check out the show notes for links to that.</p><p>Thank you so much. &nbsp;thank you for joining me on the podcast and, good luck with, moving clients to, to a post cookie, a cookie. You're welcome. </p><p>Dumky de Wilde: [00:41:57] Thank you. Thanks. It was a pleasure and thanks for the invite. </p><p>Thank you. Bye bye.

And thanks for listening to another episode of zero cafe. In this episode, I talked to designer and developer and optimizee Matt Beischel and his own agency, Korver zero, and we discussed automating parts of your CRO workflow. So you can keep focusing on the front bars of the job. My name is Carrie answer.</p><p>Welcome to shearography. What goes, where I show you the behind the scenes of optimization teams and talk with their specialist about data and human driven optimization, and implementing a culture of experimentation and a vegetation in case you missed it. In the previous episode, I spoke to Sean Shepherd from growth X about why Ciro specialists like you and me should actually be thinking like venture capitalists.</p><p>You can find that episode on zero.cafe/episodes or in the podcast app you're listening with right now, this episode of Ciroc Fe is made possible by our partners content square, fertile, online dialogue. And SiteSpect so Matt, welcome to the show and, yeah. Tell us a little bit about your background and how you are working with Shiro.</p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:01:15] Yeah, so I have a fine arts background. I got into Doing print design in high school through working on yearbook and taking art classes and stuff like that. So that really got me interested in the field of design. And from there in college did majored in actually three D animation. Cause I wanted to be like a animator and maybe get into video games and stuff, but discovered like.</p><p>That was, I wasn't really passionate about it. Like you're working on something for a super long time and you get maybe like a minutes worth of work. And so I've stayed still like taking design classes and things on the site. And web design was like a really new space then, and that really interested me.</p><p>So after leaving college, I got work in print and work in direct mail and catalog production for a couple of years and then transitioned into web design and then web development landed at an eCommerce company, whereas really able to use all those design and dev skills to work on eCommerce sites.</p><p>But as just a developer, I was always asking these questions. We're like, okay. Okay. We're working on our clients sites and making changes and updates and, redesigning pages and altering UIs and all those different things. How do we know the they're paying us to do all this work? How do we know that it's actually beneficial?</p><p>And so that's how I got into doing conversion optimization, was Fred around. I want to say. Like 2013, 2014 ish. And we somehow ended up discovering Optimizely and started using that as a layer on top of, okay. We're delivering changes, but let's test out the changes first. And so I instituted, the testing programs for clients that were interested in it and just have been doing it from there.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:20] Do you still remember the, do you still remember the first test that you know </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:03:24] now. First nations, not at all. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:27] So what were they like? Were they like big redesigns or like a big version, a versus a really big change? Or was it just small elements? You started out with </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:03:36] nothing wasn't gigantically transformative.</p><p>Like we weren't doing like an entire site redesign or anything like that. A lot of it was because I have that background in design and UI. That's what I was more focusing on. So doing things like making adjustments to say the cart page, or adding a, an interface feature to the product page, or, making navigational adjustments and things like that, rather than like promotions or aesthetic based changes, like the classic, change the button color kind of thing, which is, bullshit test anyway.</p><p>But yeah, so a lot of it was. I think in the early stages, optimizing a checkout form. Okay. Process, elimination of unnecessary fields lining up. Yeah. And put input so that it would be the easier to parse out the form and different things like that. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:31] how did this make you a better designer?</p><p>doing all these experiments? Did it change how you work </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:04:36] things? Because I had always not necessarily been distrustful of my myself, but more questioning. it </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:47] looks nice by, </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:04:48] not just looks nice, but you always like, how do you. I always struggled to find a way to quantify or prove out the value of the work.</p><p>Like how do I know that this change actually is more beneficial? Sure. I have, education and training and experience and stuff, but there's always this little bit of doubt in the back of your head, is this the right thing for this client or this websites or whatever. And When I discovered split testing, it was like, Oh, this is how I answered that question.</p><p>And yes, I can prove out like the hypothesis of, okay. I think this may be better. Let's try it out and see if it works. So absolutely it did make me a better designer because I can make more informed decisions, but also that openness to. Essentially be wrong in I don't have a vested stake in the success of this in terms of this change.</p><p>I know this change is better. I want to discover what's the best path to go down. And if it's not this design, do we need to like, do we stick with what is current or do we iterate? What kind of, how can we change or mutate or evolve? What we're working on to be performed. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:05] How big is designing still part of your </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:06:08] it's pretty big.</p><p>So the way that I work with clients, I'm basically, just an independent single person consultancy. And I do end to end. So I bring on the client, I go through the, and I go through the entire process. I'll. Do all, usually work in collaboration with them on test ideation. So coming up with all the ideas and hypothesis and stuff, but then I have a prioritization framework.</p><p>So we'll run all of the experiment ideas through prioritization, and then I'll design out the changes and build the tests, write the code in the whatever testing platform and then execute it. Do quality control, proof it out, make sure the test is set up correctly and everything, and then review results analysis with the client.</p><p>So basically it's like end to end service all the way through I do as much, or as little as the client requires. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:03] And, yeah, we wanted to talk about, automation today. you have some. Some thoughts and some ideas and how to do that. first off, what are the things that you are automating?</p><p>The things that are tedious to you </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:07:15] or annoying? So a lot of my work is focused on, like you said, elimination of TDM. I'm like, yeah. I hate being bored with work. In the sense of sure everybody's work is going to be boring in some way, but that doesn't mean your job as a whole has to be boring.</p><p>And as an example, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:38] some people </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:07:39] did like data entry, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:41] some people find joy in repetitive tasks. I can totally understand that. But for me personally, </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:07:48] it may be like a Zen. Exactly. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:51] But for me also, if it's really repetitive, it needs to do with all, all over again. The next time, are really going to try to find a way to automate it.</p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:08:00] Yeah. Like I enjoy being engaged and thoughtful about my work. Like I don't enjoy data entry and things like that as a. As a designer, like I'm always like thinking creative, like prob like problem solving. No, it's not process execution. Yeah. So much. and so look at like any process that I create.</p><p>And it's like, how can I standardize this to make it repeatable? Both in the aspects of the repeatability lends itself towards trainability so that it can scale. So it's okay, if this is you do this thing the same way, every time you can train other people to do it, but then also you can either create tools or leverage something already existing to automate that process.</p><p>as an example, like when I have a completed a split test and I want to record all of the results. Cause I collate them all to, evaluate program health, okay, if we've run 20 experiments so far this year or whatever, how many of them were. Revenue generators and this and that.</p><p>you want to store up all your stats and some of the split testing tools don't really have a program management tool, let you to collate all that data easily. So you have to do it in some sort of outside fashion. It means you have to transpose. Yes. Split test result data from the testing tool in the outside source.</p><p>Are you using a spreadsheet or something like that? I found it like it would take me 30 to 45 minutes just to record off result data. Or an experiment and it's yeah, I have to do this thing the same way every time. And I'm literally just copy paste from the web browser into a spreadsheet.</p><p>And it's so bold. It's so boring. And so unnecessary thing </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:47] online dialogue has</p><p>does and a specialist</p><p>At the</p><p>and ultimately this year salmon Mecho is hidden the only day left. When you say hope Hama upsides, sales funnels, and customer journeys. Mia info. Hi, now online dialogue fentanyl. Hey, you're not learning anything from that itself. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:10:19] it's just tedious busy work that has to be done as part of the process, but it's As a person, I shouldn't have to be doing this.</p><p>Like copying data from one source. So another, so I wrote a little JavaScripts snippet to where, like it, I have it set as a bookmarklet. I can just hit the button. It'll open. Like a little overlay on the results page. I can say, this variation was the one that I say is the winner and this and that, and pick a couple of other inputs and then hit submit.</p><p>and it just pushes off all of the scrape data into my test repository. So it's something that took me like, 30, 45 minutes. Now it takes me 10 seconds to do. And for how often I have to do that, it's like in aggregate, how much time am I saving and how much tedium am I eliminating? So doing automating all those little processes away, like repeatable tasks, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:16] why'd you pick a JavaScript.</p><p>Why didn't you just use the API of the tool and to push it to a spreadsheet or doesn't that work for the tool? Little tools have a full API available, </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:11:27] Sure. there's probably some way to do it that way, but that's like the way that I figured it out now to be fair, I use, I use a tool called air table to call it all of my test results.</p><p>it's like an online spreadsheet type of tool and I'm using their API to push the data. In, and it's a JavaScript API. So it was basically like, yeah, I just write Java script to scrape the result data. Cause I'm on the page and there's a, it can't be completely automated cause there's still a little, a couple touch points of human input that are necessary.</p><p>So I can't like just write like an automated script, Hey, go grab this data. there's still like a little human factor involved so that. That allows me to okay, pick the points that are necessary, like for human decision and then submit the data. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:18] Yeah. any other, time savers that you build, </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:12:21] I'm also using Zapier, which is a great automation tool.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:26] If there's, then that's a four pros for pro tools, business </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:12:30] tools. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. so in that same vein, like. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:36] which also worked with air. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:12:39] Yes, exactly. So I have, I have, an automation set up for when I push new split test result data in it also runs a Google analytics report to grab some data from GA for cross-referencing against the split and against the result data as well.</p><p>So that was. Also part of the time saver, another thing was that beer, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:03] how would you make sure that the data matches or the data from the experiments or the segment that you used an experiment with Google analytics? </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:13:11] So I'm not, the type of data that I'm using in GA it's really for, estimation purposes.</p><p>Rather than like rather than result analysis. So I'm really only using it, say, okay, what was this data captured in GA for the equivalent timeframe of the experiment? And then what was that data set going back a year so that I can evaluate like a percentage of say like traffic or revenue to help determine like seasonality timeframe for the experiment, for example.</p><p>Yeah. To say Okay. if this experiment generated an additional $50,000 or something in January, how heavy is this? The traffic load in January? So we can get a better estimation of Is that $50,000 sustainable throughout the year? Or is it like, Oh, Hey, that was peak season.</p><p>So like it's really not gonna generate that much, monthly. Exactly. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:10] Yeah. So you use the GA data to be able to extrapolate the results </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:14:14] yeah. To help evaluate seasonality and stuff. Yeah. It's not it's not like a hard comparison though, to your point. Like I've had thoughts around trying to wrap a process or ground.</p><p>Doing segmentation and stuff with it. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:29] Yeah. I can imagine that's really hard to automate because there, you can have infinite kinds of segments in all kinds of ways. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:14:36] And, but there could also be like some like common use case ones, okay, what was the, the segmentation across different break points or new versus returning track, there's some common recurrent ones that you could easily.</p><p>Automate now, like </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:53] the default ones automate the common ones, </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:14:57] or even like no earlier in the testing process, define what your segments are, which yeah. In my like, ideation process, I use a hypothesis builder. that I constructed. Okay. It's basically, like hypothesis Madlibs, it has all the different data points.</p><p>And like we think this, that who's the target audience, what pages are going to be. And it's basically like a way to source all of the experiments framework information. Yeah. And so if you could set that up in a way to say, these are the, these are the appropriate segments that we're targeting for the experiment.</p><p>You could carry that data through and then pull the GA segments that way as well. So it's all a matter of capturing the data when you need it and then using it at a later time and just turning it into some kind of system or process. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:54] So the form or something you use for the clients to enter the data in, or is something just for yourself or?</p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:16:00] Yes, I built it with the intent of, Getting clients to submit more hypothesis. Yeah. And also to train I'm up on that process as well. Cause like I'll, I meet with my clients every week, does transparency is very big for me, so I keep them informed and engaged right. Process. Yeah. And For a long, they'll always come with like new experiment ideas or some level of curiosity, like in some perspective that's different for me, like a really good example.</p><p>One of my clients, they have their head of customer support on there, on the call every week. And he's bringing in really useful information and feedback that their phone service representatives get all the time from customers like a customer will call and be like, Hey, I was trying to order this step.</p><p>Or another product and was having trouble this way or that way, And so there's, he's, it's a really good source of customer feedback. Yeah. but then, we'll be talking about things on the, on our phone call or meeting and things get lost because, you're trying to, you're taking meeting notes and stuff that you're discussing a bunch of things.</p><p>So I was like. How can I capture all of these ideas or also help expand the experiment maturity in the organization, by like here's this like easily shareable, like hypothesis input tool. Think of it like a virtual suggestion box, almost like that was the intent behind it. And I've had difficulty getting traction with the clients, like sharing it out.</p><p>So my stroke. So my struggle now is okay, how do I do a better job of socializing it within the client's organization to start sourcing and really </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:48] definitely something I recognize that's a lot of, even if you make it just a simple form, it's apparently really hard for people to use that as way easier for them just to send you an email.</p><p>Cause that's in their system, sending emails. That's fine. Everyone can send emails, but it's filling out the search. It's forum a, you're basically asking them to already think about, I hold all the hypothesis building. Okay. Where did you came from? What do you expect to happen? for who do you expect it to happen?</p><p>Those are difficult questions apparently. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:18:19] Yeah. Yeah. And it's hard, right? It's. Probably tricky for it to be like an organization wide thing, but probably useful for the stakeholders. And it's also like an educational component, like for the people that I'm directly interacting with. It's here's how you should be thinking of an experiment.</p><p>Like it starts with the hypothesis and this is, these are all the necessary data points to execute and construct a good experiment, So it's also a little training tool. As well to scale up the customers. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:52] Yeah. In my experience with Mitel there, it depends a bit on the company, But if afterwards you can share with the results and they're saying, Hey, but that's game from this and this guy, or grill from customer service because they filled in this form. So we know where it came from them. And that's an incentive for people. Oh, maybe I should choose a forum. So he remembers it's mine.</p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:19:13] Yeah. And I've had thoughts of since it's an input form, you can place it anywhere, right? Yeah. you can, you couldn't place a form in an email, doing something like on my little, like bookmarklet overlay tool. because a client already uses that for doing test proofing.</p><p>Like I could just add that as a feature as well. So it's Oh, they're looking at the website, they have an idea. They just hit that. And then the form comes right up and they can fill it out and put it. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:41] Yeah, I think I, I added it to two internets and I also created just like the client URL slash AB test ID or just test ID and then only make it available, with internal IPS.</p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:19:53] Yeah. Yeah. Like I have a password protected client portal where it sits now, where they can come in and submit stuff, but it hasn't sufficiently gained enough traction. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:04] SiteSpect beat veiled, vide, and unique Abby testing professionals, artsy and product recommendation. All bullshit. , this is on the tax office Kips for doing optimal performance.</p><p>the SiteSpect pulsing 80 minutes for tagging. I think guns will flicker ethic even shorter. These aren't back and forward with the</p><p>impact of open debate Testa &nbsp;SiteSpect</p><p>so what's what's the next project that you're going to be automating. What's the next thing that you're annoyed about, or maybe an expansion of a, of the things you already have. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:20:47] So lately I've been doing a lot of work around, just more broad project management. So doing things like. Essentially cutting down on the repeatable tasks that a project manager would traditionally do.</p><p>So you have certain similar of like project management software that you're already using, base camp or Trello or sauna or whatever. And someone has to that tool is only as good as the person managing it. making it easy to manage and wrangle. Like I already have a process in place for every experiment's essentially broken down into six stages of progress.</p><p>And so when an experiment moves between each stage, that's a trigger for actions to happen. So as an example, if an experiment moves into the proofing or quality. Control stage use. I use like Zapier to automatically post into the project management platform. Like it creates like the client sign off task and says, Hey, this is ready for preview.</p><p>And then it automatically assembles like the preview link that the. Client can click on to go directly to their site. And it triggers like the, the variations and the a little variation, switcher tool. Yeah. that I've built and stuff you can actually test and prove out the experiment live on their site, rather than trying to get them to log into the split testing tool and try and QC it that way and stuff.</p><p>So it's like removing all this, these friction points, but then also Taking tedious workload off of my back of like having to create that task and post it and things like that and stuff. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:22:35] Yeah. And the great thing about Zapier, if you do it that way is that you can use, almost whatever tool the client is using as a project management tool, whether it's Assana or JIRA or Trello or whatever, you can probably use that to post a task there.</p><p>So whatever they are using. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:22:52] Yeah. And my solution currently is cobbled together from air tables, Zapier and project management tool. Ideally, I would like to have like my own internal. Yeah, tool. That's like actually custom and purpose built that. Have </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:12] you ever tried? So I worked before with effective experiments.</p><p>I want to know if you </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:23:17] here's what I have, I'm familiar, but I have not tried the tool, but I, once I just, once I discovered it, I was like, in my head, I was like, this is probably the thing that I'm envisioning. So </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:28] yeah, the great thing is, so it's a separate tool, of course. So it doesn't necessarily tie into whatever the client is using.</p><p>but one of the, definitely the grid is one of the greatest things in my experience with tools like this is that indeed what you said when something moves from a different stage to another stage that usually triggers something. So I had a development stage and a design stage, which automatically would email the person responsible for designing experiments or developing experiments.</p><p>And then. The case of developing experiments, it would also automatically create a JIRA ticket for the dev team. So I can assign it to whoever they want. And that's that takes, if you just run one experiment at a time, it's fine to coordinate that. But if you go up to 10, over 10 experiments, you don't want to message everyone personally, whenever a status of an experiment that changes.</p><p>And then when it's all or workflow like yours can handle that saves so much. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:24:27] And there's also, you have to appropriately balance Timing and clutter as well. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:34] you can, again, you can overwhelm people with it. Of course, if you run a lot of experiments. So that's definitely a </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:24:39] trend just with like project management notifications and task assignments and things like if your note, you have to find the right balance.</p><p>If you're notifying people too frequently, It just becomes clutter and they tune out and ignore it. And then when something important actually comes in, it's just noise. So it ends up getting deleted. Like I remember somewhere I used to work the head, they were using JIRA and they had it set up. So that like when you created a new project and had maybe a task list of 40 different assignments and everything would get assigned on project creation.</p><p>So if you had six things assigned to you, you didn't. You would get assigned them as soon as they were all created. Yeah. And you, but you didn't, when you were able to work on them, you didn't know what your blockers were like, what the previous task for, so someone had to like actually manage all of that stuff where you had to go in and monitor it on your own.</p><p>And that was like, it's just creating too much noise and it's making it more difficult for the people, for the worker to actually find their work and accomplish it. yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:46] So what are your other experience with working with clients? I'm curious. So you do, how does the workflow usually look like?</p><p>So you say you have at least one. face to face or, remote face to face meeting with them each week. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:26:00] yeah. Yes. I'm, I'm of the opinion of being very transparent and collaborative with the client, like building that relationship and getting them involved in the process because it helps them become more invested and more of a stakeholder in the process rather than Yeah, I'll run a bunch of tests and you get a report every month or something like that in person, communication allows you to stay involved also successfully execute on relationship building, which as a consultant, how you keep and maintain clients is if you have that personal relationship.</p><p>As well. And then also it helps socialize and demonstrate the success of the program to like the client more easily shares in like the wins and the feedback. And it also trains them up to expect like individual tests or for information gathering. Like it. It eliminates that notion of Oh, I'm only going to test things that I think are going to be successful.</p><p>Like you're testing the answer questions, right? the ROI. Isn't not that the value is incidental, it helps disprove that notion of Oh, I only want to test things that I think are gonna be successful. Like I'm like, I have a question about something. let's find the answer.</p><p>And then that will eventually lead to a lift and rev. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:27:26] Yeah. I usually tell them if you have a success rates of over on our 40, 50% with your experiments, you're not experimenting enough. You might not even be experimenting because you're just testing things you already know, for sure. For whatever reason might work.</p><p>You're very conservative with what you're testing. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:27:43] There's also an, another aspect. To like you quote, like success rate. I break it down and experiments. I'm sure other people do this too, but I like to reiterate it is like you have, you don't have winners and losers. you have winners, which are, experiments that demonstrably caused a lift on whatever metric you're tracking and you have a neutral, which is inconclusive.</p><p>But then you also have a save, like no experiment is a loser. Like you're not losing revenue or losing KPI or whatever. Let's say you're saving yourself from doing damage instead. So it's more of </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:23] or wasting a little of development resources. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:28:25] Yes. Yeah. Yeah. you're saving yourself from wasting.</p><p>Resource stuff right here. you're optimizing spend. Yeah. And so I, instead of saying like 30% success rate, I actually break it down into three ways. okay. I find like 25% of the experience that I would, one are our winners and then, 10 or 15% or whatever are our saves. So it's like you have a greater.</p><p>Cumulative range of success. Now it's a little harder to quantify Oh, you're not implementing losing, you're not losing money. yeah. but there's still like value in saying, Oh, we've made sure we didn't implement something that actually would've caused damage. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:10] Yeah. Yeah. And also with, with, looking at things like wins.</p><p>And if you only look at uplift, especially, this month will be your really hard one, for a lot of companies, either you'll see a, you go up to three times or you go out, go down like 90% and that's not necessarily because you did a bad job or because you did a really good job and all already, this is proving that maybe just conversion rates or just revenue.</p><p>Might not be the best metric for what we do. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:29:39] Yeah. And with every experiment, I look at, a, I don't want to quit. I don't want to quite say top of funnel metric, but like point of change metric and then, and business result, metric. And cause they're not necessarily the same, like point of change is What's the action that's taken directly </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:01] after adding something to the basket.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:30:04] if you're making a change on the product page, is it increasing add to cart rate, but then you're still also tracking order conversion and revenue to see, okay. what's the end point business lift of the metric as well. like a really good example. I had up that testing a feature with a client about.</p><p>they have the ability to filter their reviews based on different criteria. And they had done usability testing prior to this. and this was before I engage with them and it was instituted the testing program. but they'd still done usability testing on the feature and gotten some customer feedback and stuff, and it's Oh yeah, this is a great feature.</p><p>love this. This will be super useful, And it users in quality &nbsp;feedback responded very well to the feature. But then when we're doing some testing on an unrelated thing on the product page, in some of the session replays and heat maps, I was noticing that After users engage with the filtering feature.</p><p>There were abandoning a lot of times. And so it was curious, it was like</p><p>engagement with this feature seems to increase abandonment. So the, you, it was a benefit like users were saying that was a beneficial feature, but. It was detrimental to the business metrics. So there was a, there's a dissonance here, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:31:37] Becca on the front ends our beta test and happy Oak lost from the beginning.</p><p>The flicking evaluatees did come through. The key test has not to be included and imposed active test tells that no Tyler's yet. Phobia convert comes our beta testing software. The smart insert that'll hit about any flickering of &nbsp;faith gifts. Now that our support fee a 24 seven chat, the health would go up and dive at the last minute, it was 15 Kia, carbon positive.</p><p>If you do this yourself, you have a knife and the fork and the cleaner artsy plus a year during</p><p>I can imagine if, but if the, if it's filters on things that people once, but you don't have the products to match, they will abandon. So they like using the filter. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:32:23] it's not filtering products. It's filtering review information. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:32:26] Oh, okay. Oh, okay. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:32:27] Yeah. So the, yeah, but you're what you're saying is correct.</p><p>And we were noticing, like the users were engaging with those filters, but there were. Filtering on so many criteria that they were filtering away, all the reviews entirely too many filters and being left with nothing. And so it was an unintentional negative experience of Oh, there's no useful information for me here.</p><p>So I, I can't make a decision. So I'm going to leave. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:32:52] I once had a great, a small anecdote, aside that's a, that offered filtering, both. Whatever the filters, were on top of that page four for summary. So if you didn't have any results, and so if you filter too far down, if it didn't have any results, it didn't necessarily, they didn't have a numbers.</p><p>besides the filters indicating how many results you would get. So it was a bit of a surprise that didn't have that feature yet. So people filter too far down and then we'll happens when you don't, you didn't get any results. You did get some suggestions of other products, that might be interesting and the same category or whatever.</p><p>but they didn't see. They didn't have any results. So what happens, you feel too far down, there were no results, but you did see products that were not matching your results. There were other suggestions, because they didn't want to show an empty page, to prevent that for I bring, which is in itself might be a good idea.</p><p>But because it didn't communicate, Hey, there is no originals. people were very confused. Like I'm filtering down on Samsung TVs and are still see Phillips or Sony TVs in my results or what they think or thought they had his results. So yeah. Filtering can be tricky. Yeah.</p><p>so you, so when we, were talking before this, I we're talking about, client projects, you also mentioned client onboarding. So basically a step back from a client communication. so what do you do with client onboarding? How do you sets, the rights, expectations from clients on what's going to happen now?</p><p>Fast results will be, coming in and that kind of stuff. How do you approach that? </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:34:37] That's it? That's an interesting question. So my onboarding process typically takes about a month and that's mostly from I have, I have pre-prepared onboarding documentation that outlines like. here's program requirements like expectations, et cetera.</p><p>But then also like technical guides, like here's how you should install the split testing tool and the heat mapping tool and, get logins and reconciled with all the accounts and all that stuff. And then, we'll set up, like the weekly was set up like the weekly meeting cycle.</p><p>And then really the first month is just a lot of like qualitative and quantitative data collection. And in the meetings, it's like a lot of just experiment ideation. So training the client up on like the hypothesis generation process, Hey, here's the hypothesis builder. Let's walk through it.</p><p>No, you have a couple of questions, ideas. So here's, you give them to me and I'll show you like, okay, here's how I would take that and formulate it into a hypo. Yes. or some such. And then, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:35:47] you wouldn't be running any experiments in the first month, right? </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:35:50] no. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:35:51] or just like an AA experiments, maybe.</p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:35:54] yeah, I'll do a couple like validation experiments to make sure that the testing tool is set up correctly and everything. Yes, of course. but other than that, no, not really any kind of like hard heart testing. it, it also depends a little bit on how fast the client gets up to speed.</p><p>As well. Yeah. If they have a couple ideas that they're really ready to go with and we can, and they have a good development process in place and they can get everything installed and working correctly quickly, then you know, it's a lot of it is dependent on the client. And so some of it is just wrangling of Hey, do to get that script installed.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:36:32] Yeah. And so I'm ready to use lead, where you are these coming from? Is it a user already mentioned customer service as input for those </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:36:41] hypotheses? So I'll source test ideas from anywhere. client can submit them, or a lot of the other States will just be me auditing the site to come up with.</p><p>Ideas, look at it, do some sort of UI UX audit, look through Google analytics or whatever analytics tool they're using to identify, where some particular drop off points, evaluate like traffic areas. Yeah, segments, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:37:13] et cetera. And, earlier you also mentioned, why sticking to plan, test, run time parameters is important.</p><p>I think there's a whole topic for many people working with directly with clients. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:37:25] We're actually discussing that a little bit, at the, at the weekly standup today, someone was asking a question. About that. Yeah. And my S my starting point is really is looking at the marketing or the purchase cycle of this, of the segment that you're testing and seeing okay, if it's, if we're testing primarily on first time visitors, and we can do that terms historically, it takes them about 30 days from first site visit to.</p><p>Make that first purchase, then the experiment room needs to run at least that long to capture first transaction of first user that came into the experiment. so starting with just a touch, just your expected purchase or behavioral change timeframe. And then using that to estimate on sample size, feeding that into a calculator to determine your minimum detectable effect and then evaluating again, and then doing some kind of sanity check on the numbers that you'd come up with there.</p><p>so if you get a sample size of 3000 and an MD, if 80%. that's completely, that's completely unreasonable. So it's okay, what's we have to reevaluate and change some of these numbers around to get some sort of sane timeframe and sign saying detectable effect.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:38:57] Yeah. I was talking to I'm a web shop owner, I think six months ago. And they sold kitchens. Online, but the average time there to go from, browsing for new kitchen to actually buying a kitchen is like multiple months. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:39:11] Yeah. That's so yeah, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:39:13] if you cannot run an experiment on from first time visitor to actually, purchasing a kitchen.</p><p>if the lead time is way over, whatever your, Your cookie settings can handle. Yeah. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:39:28] And for something like that, it'd almost be more like, Looking at like lead capture or higher, what's the higher </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:39:34] touch point. So you need to go form a for things like that, people, going from a four brochure or whatever, or just not focused on first time visitors, but the repeat visitors, if someone visits your site five times, then it might be a different story, </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:39:47] right?</p><p>Yeah. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:39:48] So w what came out of the discretion that is often known with the Roundup? </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:39:52] Yeah, that was the focus. It was like someone who's having a question around. how do you evaluate that from a project management standpoint? So I just it just exposed my process, okay.</p><p>First I think about it from the standpoint and then work forward from there and then do some sanity checks on the information that pops out. And it's is this workable? Is this reasonable? Yes, we can proceed forward or do we need to make adjustments? Like for example, I have one client there.</p><p>Their purchase time is usually around 60 days, so we're not always testing on transaction cause that's a pretty long purchase window. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:40:31] Exactly. Yeah. And it could be one of the questions in your, in your workflow. maybe even, just off the top off, just building, asking those kinds of questions, like what's the business cycle for this.</p><p>And just to remind yourself. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:40:44] Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:40:45] Okay. Yeah. That makes sense. just to remind yourself, okay. Yeah, definitely. That's something I should be checking first before we build the whole thing. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:40:53] Yeah. So I have, I have that broken down. So ideas stayed. So the first stage is the idea stage, and that's really just coming up with an idea, there's no, not quantifying it or assigning numbers to it at all yet.</p><p>It's just. Sourcing ideas. Cause I don't want to, I want to disabuse the client of the notion of Oh, that's a dumb idea or whatever. no, like no idea is a bad idea. Just source everything first, just cultivate a healthy sense of curiosity about the website, questioning things.</p><p>So coming up, just coming with ideas, it's just pure text, pure information. We think, we think this, so we want to make this change for this reason. So just come up with an idea and then we'll move it into the planning stage. And that's where we start to quantify stuff. So that's the stage where we'll say, okay, what's the right.</p><p>what's the transaction timeframe for this? What's the, what's an estimated sample size. What's an estimated run technical effect. And then using those quantified values. As a prioritization method. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:41:54] Yeah. And a need to check those practical things. Again, like I said, with a sample size, can I run this experiment?</p><p>Does it make sense? </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:42:01] So right. Taking those numbers and then feeding it into a sample size and a duration calculator. And it's does the duration, does the calculate a duration. Reconcile with our PR our purchase window. And also, is it a reasonable timeframe to run an experiment?</p><p>Like I remember one time, I think it was because I made a calculation error actually. Like they ended up running like the sample size calculator and comparing against the average daily traffic of the page. And it was like, This experiment's going to take 170 days throughout. And I was like, okay. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:42:38] Yeah. What I'd also like to add is, usually with what we already spoke about, you have the different outcomes of an experiment. And I like to force teams upfront to think about, okay, if we have these outcomes, What will happen? what would it mean for us? what would change or what would, will we implement something?</p><p>wouldn't be do anything or, we'll be around a followup experiments because if you're running an experiment, then you'd have no idea whatever the outcome is. Nothing's going to change. Maybe that's not an experiment you should run anyway. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:43:11] Yeah. And I classify experiments into at least one of two types.</p><p>There's Prospective and iterative perspective or like your big transformative, we have no idea what's gonna happen, but this is something interesting. And then your iterative ones are like, those are the more that, like the sherbets like we already have some historical data around here, or it's a followup from a previous experiment where one, two.</p><p>brief, refine our changes a little bit more </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:43:38] with, the big chains. You probably have an idea. Okay. if this is this works, then Oh, wow. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:43:43] yeah. And </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:43:44] that is, we can do this. We can visit. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:43:45] Yeah. And typically the clients, like that's where they're relying on the experimenter's insight.</p><p>Cause you have historical experience like, Oh yeah. I've tested this six other times and it worked. 85% of the time or whatever. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:43:59] So that's great, man. Thanks for sharing all of that. last thing I'm interested in and you'll give a lot of inspiration to those clients and, in all the work that you do, a hypothesis that you were created for them.</p><p>So where do you get your inspiration from? Oh, boy. </p><p>not besides zero round tables. That is, </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:44:15] yeah. that's a pretty recent thing actually, but it's healthy because having that sort of face to face vocal communication is way more. Meaningful and valuable then say link LinkedIn, comment and chains or whatever, even though those are still they're still good and stuff.</p><p>It's interesting. Like just general inspiration comes from lots of different sources. I'm very big on UX. I also play a lot of video games. Viewing games are all about user experience and user interface, interacting with the interfaces, basically how you play the game.</p><p>And the quality of the interface is going to determine how successful we're terrible, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:44:56] how enjoyable </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:44:57] it is, How enjoyable the gameplay is. Yeah. And I've been playing games for a long time, even just all the way back to the days, like the original, like Nintendo or even a target, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:45:07] but it doesn't, that doesn't necessarily have to be stairs instead as you're out.</p><p>we all know Minecraft. It's not necessarily the higher resolution that's blowing you away, right? </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:45:18] no. And I was a big world of Warcraft player for. Probably 12 years and, as designer like completely built and customized out my own interface, control scheme for that was able to optimize my play.</p><p>and just building off of that experience, and you'll see it like a lot of other people who aren't designers, they'll post screenshots of like their interface and stuff and their screen is cluttered with 50 different. Action buttons and stuff. And it's you're restricting like your viewport of being able to see what's going on in the playfield.</p><p>And so it's what's striking to me, it was like this really the concept of like timeliness of importance, like timeliness of relevant information. there's this huge amount of information that you need when you're playing a game, but not all of it is relevant all the time. Like you only need to know say this ability is ready for you to use.</p><p>You only need to know, like when it's available, you don't need to know when it's not like you can hide the icon or something, or have some sort of like highlight or like glowing field or something. So that sort of like. Priority of relevance is a big, important feature in gaming. And so </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:46:27] yeah.</p><p>So it's the interface, adapting to what your, whatever you need right then and there that's </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:46:31] right. Exactly. Yeah. And so </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:46:33] I have this, I have this, this, a stream deck right here. With all kinds of action buttons. but it depends on the program I have opened at that time. So if I have Chrome open, there are different wallets.</p><p>Don't have any actions for Chrome, but theoretically for Chrome, I could have different action butters for Photoshop or for premiere or for a game. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:46:53] Exactly. Yeah. so that, and then I've been doing, I've been doing more reading. Lately I've been picking up like books on consulting and AB testing and things like that.</p><p>Cause I feel like my statistics game is pretty weak. So I've been reading a lot of like more of the </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:47:12] statistics base, any recommendation that funds. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:47:14] Absolutely. I was, I've been reading through, your guys' book. statistical methods </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:47:19] in online AB testing. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:47:21] Yeah. that's been a very good one useful one.</p><p>I know a lot of like more, less statistically minded people are like, it's really dry and hard to read, but I'm finding it interesting and relevant there. And being able to incorporate those things into the process. like circling back around to say automation, same kind of thing.</p><p>okay. I have all of my stuff. Statistics that I'm trying to calculate, like saying planning stage again, that's a repeatable process. So I like having to go in and say, you'll manually type a bunch of numbers into a statistical calculator. that's tedious work. Like it would be interesting if say like some of the split testing tools actually incorporated those.</p><p>In their PR like, and I think in general, most of the split testing tools that I've used do a poor job around okay. The stuff, the actual, underlying statistics of the test, like helping to determine and evaluate detectable effect and. and if you have a reasonable sample size and things like that, like they're airing too far on the side of simplicity.</p><p>And that's where, not that CRO has like a bad name or anything, but that's where you get like a lot of the snake oil kind of things, where you see people like posting test results. Online or writing a case study where they're have like, Oh, we tested 300 visitors and got a 250% uplift after two days.</p><p>And I'm like, sure, the results are full </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:48:55] of shit. your results probably just fine, but it's not going to be useful for you in the future. </p><p>Yeah. That's that happens. and, is it helpful if you have someone that's done it, but do you also, so you read books, do you also do all like online courses, that's something that's, that you do or reading books more and more useful to you?</p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:49:14] Reading has been more useful to me and also just, my own, just online shopping experiences, like I'll go out and look at yeah. ECommerce sites and be like, Oh, here, it's interesting the way that they're doing this or that or something and take notes and solicit feedback and do things like that.</p><p>So just like just observational journeying. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:49:39] yeah. Yeah. For me, I tried to both read books and do online courses. I think with. It takes me more effort to open a book and then starting an online course, that's easier for me. but I'm definitely way more distracted when I'm behind my computer.</p><p>So I definitely, when I do an online course, definitely need to shut down everything that's available. Ideally if possible, also download the online course and then just do it from my computer without any wifi on to minimize distractions. otherwise I am. </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:50:09] Yeah, there's I haven't really been doing, I haven't really gotten into.</p><p>Online courses. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:50:15] You said you started reading books, but is that a recent change because of the whole coronavirus thing or was it already on </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:50:22] I've always been a book reader. yeah. Yeah. I'm more of like a reading and inexperience. Learner. So for me, it's more Oh, I'll read about something, then I'll go do it and </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:50:32] try it again.</p><p>Yeah. You have your notebook on the side saying, okay, this is something I should incorporate </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:50:37] as an experimenter. Try it. Test it, fail at it. Figure out what didn't work </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:50:42] and yeah, exactly. Matt, thanks so much. It was lovely talking to you. Our time is up. Thanks so much. Yeah. We have some links to include in the show.</p><p>Notes are everything that we spoke about. For example, the book, you'll find a link in the show notes below, in this, this podcast. thanks again, Matt. Good luck. I'm reading. and yeah, building those automations. if you have more, please share them with us. We definitely want to know </p><p>Matt Beischel: [00:51:10] we'll do.</p><p>Thank you. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:51:14] Thanks so much, Matt, for giving us some inspiration on what we can automate to make our work lives a bit less tedious. Good luck with all what you do and talk to you soon. This will season two episode 17 of zero cafe with Matt Boshell from Corvus hero.

Welcome to our cafe. We have a bar actually. yeah. Could you introduce yourself? you just did a session, right? Yeah. </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:12:33] before lunch.</p><p>So called flee people didn't leave for food before I finished. So I guess that was encouraging. my name is &nbsp;I'm senior product manager of analytics at Autodesk and welcome. I'm very happy to be here. I found out about Sierra cafe today. So now I've subscribed </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:52] on Spotify instead of a podcast, </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:12:55] or I could not find you guys on </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:57] exactly.</p><p>We have a, there's a gap apparently. And so we need to make sure that we're also involved </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:13:03] in United States. And we talked a little bit this morning and you were telling us about your new talk. How did it go? </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:13:10] I think that it went very well. I, got some questions at the end. so that's usually encouraging, there are a couple of people that stopped by and thank me.</p><p>So that is always good. All right. So from my perspective, it was a success. Okay, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:25] good. Let's talk about those questions in a minute, but first, what was your session about the title was analytics is a product. Let's treat it as such. </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:13:35] Yes. very, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:36] I feel that there's a, like a frustration of the lying, </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:13:40] that much frustration.</p><p>Really what my talk was about. Bringing up the work that we do every day and making it more meaningful, making it more of a product than just an offering that we do. Usually a lot of times what we do every day is more of services. It's more kind of, doing small things for everyone else and we don't treat the work that we do.</p><p>Good enough. So my talk was a, probably a little bit more of an inspirational talk about changing better. It's more about changing the way you think about the work that you do, changing your thinking from the fact that you're making a project, changing that into the fact that you're doing a product.</p><p>So stop minimizing the work that we're doing and making it more meaningful for both the company and yourself. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:36] Is it something, we, as in the group of analysts, are we doing something wrong or is it the way people view our work? Yes,</p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:14:46] I think it's both, but where I think it starts is from us. And that was one of the points of my slides. It was that we actually minimize the work that we do. A lot of what we're doing everyday. and I went through some of the examples of the dashboards, new tools or platforms, implementations, or running an optimization practice.</p><p>Yes. Those are actual products. Those are products that we provide to our business customers and business customers. I mean our internal business customers, not our external consumers. It's more all the customers that we have internally. And we should think about our stakeholders more as customers.</p><p>We as a company, think of everyone outside as customers, we should start thinking also internally that everyone within our company is our customer. And if we start thinking more in that way, maybe we will treat our work a little bit more of a, like a product. So I went through the different stages of, the product process and how tried to show everyone that.</p><p>What we are already working on is very close to the product process. We're just not thinking about it as such and trying to think a little bit bigger and trying to think about everything that we do every day as something that is more important, can help us represent it at the end. Some things that's more important and help our business customers treat it as something that's more important.</p><p>So it's both sides, but. honestly, it will be really hard for us to quickly change what our business customer think about us, but we should first start changing what we ourselves think about. Yeah. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:16:30] And, in what ways do you think, we minimize the work </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:16:33] that we do. </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:16:35] in, first of all, we often think of it as that it's like one and done.</p><p>We don't take the time to advertise it, then promoted enough within our companies. And we don't take the time enough to grow it or to maximize reach with the products that we develop. So when you create a dashboard or when you create a new tool, you need to spend the time to actually market it. And some of the things that I went through a little bit was when you create a physical product, You go through all the marketing channels that you can think about, right?</p><p>You do a SCM, you do display advertising. You do all of that in order to reach more people. But when we create an internal product, we don't actually try to take the time to go through all of these steps. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:17:25] We throw it to him say, and </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:17:28] we throw them to them. We send an email or two, maybe we do a training session or two, but we need to take a little bit more effort to actually advertise it.</p><p>I had some examples, like making posters, doing little social events, like cupcakes or the display advertising. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:17:44] Yeah. I think at a company it's a Netherland in the Netherlands when mobile was a was up and coming. the lead CRO was dressed up as a mobile phone for a week. And then I think they did a few years just to create yeah, just for awareness, something like that.</p><p>Yeah. To create awareness and have people ask him, what are you doing? then you can explain it. </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:18:09] Guinness book of world records attempt in there. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:11] Yeah. maybe not sure if that's a world record I would want to have, but </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:18:16] just ask you a question. Only three people raised their hands.</p><p>When he talked about planning, how has, how does that differ in between different countries, different events, where you asked the same question? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:25] What was the question? </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:18:26] I asked how many people, one of the stages of the product processes plan. So I ask how many people plan. About the things that they develop and yeah, it was, I was surprised.</p><p>I think honestly, they were not sure what I was talking about. The question was, how many of you plan of how you're going to make your product real? How are you going to get that dashboard to be done? I frankly cannot accept that it only three people in the whole audience plan, the Kyle to make things done.</p><p>it's unrealistic every single person. Has that even, let's say that dashboard, something that you will create in couple of hours or a day, you still in your mind plan, how are you going to approach it? What are you going? What are the steps that you're going to do in order to complete it? What are you going to, what data are you going to use?</p><p>What visualizations are you going to use? How you're going to lay it out. How are you going to actually then complete it? And how are you going to send an email and be. In a way in the release phase. And I think that people just don't realize, and I might need to adjust my presentation for one of the next times to talk a little bit more about that process, because even subconsciously every single one of us is planners, because otherwise you're not going to be able to complete anything.</p><p>But yeah, maybe subconsciously </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:19:53] I speak from experience from companies where I've done some work. A lot of people just start creating dashboards. They start creating the product and they skip the planning part. And then, so when Pete only three people raised their hands, maybe it's realistic. Yeah.</p><p>It could be. And it's a, it kudos to those three, raising their hands that it does take effort. It does take a, self control to take a step back, evaluate what you want to achieve and create that planning for </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:20:21] it. Yeah, then I'm really surprised and yes, with the dashboard might be simpler, but anything else, an implementation you have to plan for that, right?</p><p>Especially if you need to start involving other teams like engineering teams, you have to plan. So I think that maybe people work on </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:43] there's also a there's a danger in just creating dashboards for people. If you don't really know. What they're going to use it for, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:20:49] If they're going to use it at all.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:53] I've often given the example in the podcast that I once came at a company, and I think I mentioned it today already, but that the report they had, the data, they had, the eCommerce manager, what they saw on a daily basis was the number of orders that they got. That's the only thing that they got. So they started just giving discounts to make those numbers go up.</p><p>and that's. So you're trying to help them by giving them a dashboard. But if the data is incomplete or not necessarily what they actually need, it can actually maybe even bring your company down if you, </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:21:23] at least you had transactions. I know of an international company. pan European company only used a number of.</p><p>users, visitors to just to evaluate the performance of their website, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:21:36] no budget to CRO and all the budget to, to search engine marketing </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:21:41] can easily create a little bot. And then it's yes, the </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:21:44] worst performers. </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:21:46] Yeah. That's why then I'm actually probably surprised because I would have told them I just time.</p><p>And I've been in analytics now for like almost 10 years out, have told that we're past the time where we have to ask that question. Why? and from my perspective, if you're an analyst, if you're a good analyst, if you're good at your job, you will be asking that question. So with you example, in just showing or there is, why, what are they trying to do?</p><p>And they're just trying to increase orders grade, but I really doubt that's the goal. Yeah. And, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:22:19] so there were multiple countries, so one of the countries, they were like a challenger, so they were new in the market and that makes sense. they, yeah. Then you can, you want to increase market share.</p><p>You may even want or accept that you are losing money for a couple of years. Maybe that's fine. If that's a conscious strategy, but not if you applied everywhere for everyone. And yeah, </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:22:39] it reminds me of a Avinash Kaushik, three wise process. I think it was afternoon. And she said, when everybody, whenever somebody asks you for that, you need to track some data.</p><p>You have to challenge them three times and haven't answered that question. Why three times, why do you want it? And they will give you a response. Ask why, again. Yeah. And try to drill down to the core issue that are the core piece of information that thereafter. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:02] Yeah, maybe five times, eight times.</p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:23:06] It is really amazing that, frankly, and we still get to talk about some of these things, which are basics in the digital analytics space. But the funny part is that we still talk about it. And we still talk about it. Like almost like it's new and it's not. so I don't know why is that maybe more people need to go to more events like this and conferences or listen to more podcasts.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:29] And so we just spoke to a whim from Mamoa the organization behind this, conference and they, their organization already exists 80 years so far. Before we had something called the internet. but I think so, but internet and having these amounts of data that is still relatively new, right? So still trying to cope with having so much data and growing up the digital is growing up really fast because we have so much data we can and with great power.</p><p>but in that sense, it's still, there are a lot of growing pains still in our industry. </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:24:03] Oh, I agree. It's just that would have called that we go past the basics and we start worrying a little bit more about, okay, great. You wanted to show this one metric on your dashboard, but now what is the next level of data that you need in there to start making better business decisions?</p><p>What do you want to layer on </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:24:26] and talking about that? How do you, what's your opinion on how CRO has affected. Data collection, activities. I, from personal experience, I get the feeling that CRO is getting a lot more priority within companies, than optimizing data collection. B is closer to your P and L, which is weird </p><p>because a lot of CRMs it's dependent on proper data.</p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:24:46] Yeah. But don't a lot of people see CRO mainly as a, the color of the button and an AB </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:24:53] test is </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:24:55] the first step that people think about when they think about TRO and then the CRO guy or girl of course has to tell them, yeah, I want to do that. But you do realize that the data I need isn't good enough. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:10] I think I'm going to class and spoke about it this morning.</p><p>I don't know if you've visited her session, but she spoke about. We also didn't finish their session cause we're already recording and we get a pass. We spoke to her afterwards, about this being a big problem that, a lot of people in Ciro also don't really, check, if the data that they collect is actually what they assume that they are collecting.</p><p>So maybe there are a lot of assumptions that we are all doing, that the data is correct. Or even measuring what we are measuring or. A lot of people not doing, separates, mismatch, checks before they started analyzing. and, and just hope or assume and hope that it's correct. And then either don't have the knowledge or, yeah, we don't have the budgets for it anyway.</p><p>So let's not bother </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:25:55] or, one thing I'll challenge though, is being in the subscription based business, which more and more of the businesses are in that direction. It's great to get the initial conversion, but if you don't retain that customer, then it really doesn't matter for me, if you convert somebody and then they leave a month later, that is basically wasted money because often depending on the cost of your product, that conversion might have cost you more than that monthly fee.</p><p>So as you get more and more, especially in the subscription based businesses, Starting to think about the retention, the renewal that the customers are doing becomes more and more important because ultimately where you're going to be making the money is that when you get that customer and then you have to stop thinking about that.</p><p>When you have to stop thinking about trying to onboard them, you have to some process that gets them. To stay. You have a product that's good enough that gets them to stay. So sometimes looking at that only initial conversion starts to become obsolete because it's not relevant for a lot of the companies.</p><p>Granted it completely is dependent on your business, but that's why some of the basic metrics. Yeah, it doesn't matter. </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:27:16] That's an interesting point because I know from personal experiences and not on a company level, The, there are a lot of Dutch companies and I think it's, I'm looking at a photo and you read that Bart's, the, energy companies, they would offer premiums for new customers.</p><p>So you would get a huge discount or you would get a tablet at the time. Remember those tablets, they were giving away </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:27:38] the same with the telecom </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:27:40] companies. Yeah. But only for new customers, not for the people, not for the customers who are loyal and willing to stay. That's </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:27:47] highly incentivized to switch every year.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:27:49] Yeah. It might also be different by a data problem, because I love that. Like Google analytics, you're almost well, the default setup at least, and you lose them, you lose cookies. So the default setup is you can track them until their first order. Yeah. And then, yeah, we don't know. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:28:05] Also with the telemarketing of most of those companies, everybody's rewarded for the first nobody's rewarded for retention.</p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:28:14] So why would you care about retention? </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:28:16] Yeah. I think that you can do retention multiple ways. Obviously, if you provide too much incentives for switch, then yes, the customer can go and switch multiple times. but at the same time, if you have a product that's good enough that customer doesn't want to switch, then it makes a difference.</p><p>Okay. Your electricity, do you get electricity from one company or another? Probably doesn't really matter. Unless one of them has outages all the time. Then. Honestly, no matter what kind of incentives they might want to give you probably are not going to switch. So it's about making your product better.</p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:28:52] Oh, here's an interesting one. You're from America, Amazon and Kindle or NASA, audible audio books. They have the most interesting model that I've ever seen. It's a subscription based model and you pay a certain fee and you get credits every month by monthly or maybe more than one a month to purchase books.</p><p>However, when your men subscribing member, the prices of the books are reduced by a certain percentage and what I figured out, and it's not rocket science, but the prices of the books actually are reduced to a point where they're cheaper than the credit you just </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:26] purchased. The credits, I think are around $11.</p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:29:30] Yeah. Let's say 1195, but then you can buy the book for nine magnifies. what do you do? Do you spend your credit and lose $2? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:36] That's all. I'll always look at that site. Logs are like, love the more newer book, like $25. Okay. I'll use credit for that cheaper than 11. </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:29:45] And then they have the whisper sync. If you buy the, if you buy the Kindle version.</p><p>Yeah. It reduces the price to four 95. Yeah. It's and then I ended up saving all my credits. Because I ended up purchasing all, I paid money for the better deals that I'm getting as a paid subscriber. So I don't know what they're doing, but it's a very interesting </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:30:04] see though, there is also not an alternative service that you can actually get, so in a way they can do, but </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:30:12] yeah, not as good as a non English speaking people.</p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:30:15] do you have any tips or advice for ways to promote your analytics? Inside the company </p><p>as a product, obviously, except for wearing a special suit. </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:30:27] Yeah. my point was that first we need to start thinking about the analytics as a product and present it as a product to our customers and consumers.</p><p>A couple of the tips that I gave was a little bit more around the launch and how do you go and try to promote it? he was referring about my display advertising, which was making posters and putting them all around the company about that new product of developing leader dashboard or a new platform that you're integrating, doing a social event who doesn't like free food.</p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:31:00] I sold it. I sold the slide. </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:31:03] Yes. I wasn't sure if they are popular here. Yeah. They're still popular in the us. So yeah. Doing something where you can get people together. To talk about the product that you've developed so they can be a little bit more perceptive receptive. And the other part was trying to get your own influencers on people that will do the reviews for the product that you've developed so they can spread the word for you, but it takes some planning.</p><p>It takes some time. And I will tell you we're not perfect on that because always there is something new that you need to develop. And you are always in that rush of, Oh my God. Let's do new things like doing, let's do new things and you really have to step back and allow more time for spreading the word and making things available.</p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:31:50] How do you filter out the opinion of the boss and </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:31:53] the donuts? I know </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:31:56] that's an option. </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:31:58] are you meaning that the boss would not want to? </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:32:00] no. You have your product. But your boss might have an opinion about that product that he, that conflicts with what the actual end users, have in terms of wishes or of improvements </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:32:11] the hippo.</p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:32:12] I didn't want to use the word, but yeah. </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:32:15] Yeah. okay. Frankly, I'm probably known as probably a little bit of a too onus person at my company and around everyone that knows me. So I don't give a shit. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:32:27] Yeah. </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:32:28] Yeah. Okay. I wasn't sure how a humbled scale </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:32:31] where </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:32:33] public, right? Yeah, no. I think it's much more important to make other people that are going to be actual users actually adopt your product than trying to worry about the opinion of your own boss.</p><p>And frankly, if you manage to get other support. And that will make your boss look good in front of his boss, because now people are adopting that product. I don't really think that there'll be a problem. Yeah. But also you should have told you boss to begin with, you should have told them, Hey, this is what we're doing.</p><p>And this is why a lot of times, depending on the manager, if you can put it either in two ways, either how it's going to benefit the business or it, how it's going to benefit them. It's works. Depends how </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:33:20] much? 10%. </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:33:22] Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:33:23] Yeah, exactly. And ideally both. Ideally. Yeah. Matthew, you joined the session. What's your main takeaway or your, now productizing your services?</p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:33:33] I have been thinking about it. Definitely. I was very surprised about the planning and that does, does fall into place with what I've been experienced. I do a lot of time management and I, when I come into companies, there's. Nine out of 10 times, there's no documentation. There has been no prior planning for the data collection activities that companies have been doing.</p><p>But what I really liked, and I think it takes a lot of guts. You focused on that during your presentation is the retirement. Sometimes you need to let go and move on. and I think that's a critical part, especially for looking at the developments in tools like Google analytics. We've had classic analytics, we've had universal analytics.</p><p>So now for a lot of companies, there'll be a let go moment to move on to webinar. So I think that timing of your comment, that the last piece of the process is very important and that companies will need to embrace that letting go moment and move on to webinar as Krista site and said the writing's on the wall.</p><p>This is going to become permanent and the companies will have to change. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:34:30] So as in letting go of the use for data collection or </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:34:35] moving on to the next version of the tool? Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:34:38] Yeah. </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:34:39] Okay. From what I understood and don't hold me, don't hold me to it. But a universal analytics at some point will be a deprecated and everyone will need to move on to the webinar.</p><p>and that's the letting go part that companies will need to, take seriously in the next coming years. Okay. </p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:34:54] Yeah, no, definitely the let go part is important. And that's why I tried to put it from the perspective that if you retire something, you get the full permission to do something new innovate and create something new.</p><p>And everyone should be excited about that. I imagine that everyone who is working on Google analytics implementations, they should be excited about the new stuff that Google is bringing in because, Hey, how long have we been doing universal analytics? I think it's now be like five years. Aren't you tired of it?</p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:35:28] I think I'll have a launch party. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:35:29] Usually people are a lot more excited about new things then about, optimizing the existing. </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:35:35] There's a funny anecdote. I think I just wrote a blog post about it because Google, tag manager just turned seven years and I'm often seen as the odd ball at parties because I get very excited, enthusiastic about new releases and Google tag manager.</p><p>But within my social group, nobody has exposure. Everybody looks like and speaking, cling on. When I say, Hey, did you see the new custom templates in Google tag </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:35:56] manager, </p><p>Matthew Niederberger: [00:35:58] but we need to, start using those things and carry on with what we're doing and hopefully, possibly, improve what we're doing.</p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:36:05] Yeah. You look at something that you currently have. If there is an opportunity for improvement, you improve it. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:36:14] I think that's a great note to end the podcast on, Matthew product. thank you very much. I hope you guys have a lovely day and a lot of these stay in the Netherlands, so I would assume.</p><p>Prolet Miteva: [00:36:25] Thank you. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:36:25] and we'll, look for, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:36:27] yeah, thank you very much. Thank you.</p><p>‍</p>",,de14e0ec

He is the Vice President of Innovation at the data insights and consulting company, Kantar and he is a multi-award winning market researcher known worldwide for his thought leadership and new perspectives on the way in which we conduct user and product research. My co-host Bart van der Meer and I spoke with Jon at the beginning of February at a conference and we spoke about his recent paper on developing a more robust measurement tool that can provide a clear picture of human decision making at scale, as well as the techniques he learned along the way that can be applied in the wider world of research.

What's your session about? </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:02:09] some work we've been doing with a colleague of mine in WPP. Ogilvy called Christopher. Grace is a very fun, boring character.</p><p>And Ogilvy have got quite an advanced viewpoint on using behavioral science in communication planning. And they very interested in understanding human decision making processes, how people think and link to things, things like people's personality. and how they see the world. And and, the papers about the story that, the journey we went on to try and work out a better way of measuring all that in traditional market research, because SSH is actually quite a challenge to measure just the basics of people's personalities.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:55] It's not as easy as MBTI</p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:03:00] he tries to slip in MBTI whenever he gets the opportunity. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:04] Yeah. </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:03:06] Yes, lots of there's lots of challenges on lots of levels. the paper that we published around the methodology it's worth anyone reading thing, get hold of the copy. It just tells the series of experiments that we, the undertook to try and explore better ways of getting people to really reveal who they are and how they think.</p><p>and trying to overcome some of the frailties in that process and some of the classical ways that, people measure personality in particular, fraught with error. and we dismantled some of the classical techniques and then try to stick them back together again, using different approaches.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:47] so what are those findings? </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:03:49] in a nutshell, if you were to say the biggest challenge, when I'm trying to measure say your personality in particular is self assessment bias. Yeah. most personality as function of things like, how agreeable you are. And very few people are going to admit that they're not very agreeable or, there's, this level of conscientiousness is one of the classical big five personality traits.</p><p>No one admits to being unconscious. &nbsp;disorganized people just refuse to acknowledge that they are. And so you </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:21] to develop a question that somehow people can answer, honestly. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:04:27] Yeah. Because yeah, because it's viewed </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:04:30] as a negative. So what we, what we were able to demonstrate was how it, how that completely corrupts a personality test.</p><p>Cause what you get is everyone's in the top half of some sort of. Yeah, everyone likes it. So what we had, we developed quite a lot interesting techniques to try and resolve that simply by making people aware of their biases. We found that she quite effective. You basically, we use the grumpy cat mean, it was seriously factor thing.</p><p>We ever tried to work out how to get people conscious in a nice, friendly way about the fact that people aren't suffering selective about some things. So we showed the grumpy cat. Yeah, I'm happy. Then ask people to tell us some of the, how they feel they are compared to other people. And we doubled the amount of moodiness, for example, lots of people when they were exposed to that type of thing, we also discovered that people are able to more objectively look at their past their youth, their growing up period, more than that, they're there now.</p><p>So I'm not going to admit that I'm commonly late for meetings. I'm prepared to admit that I was late for school. And so what we realized is that navigating through to the past, it was a good way of, and a lot of our personalities established in the teenage years. And so quite a good rich way to mine, real behavior out of, out the past where people are able to process it.</p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:05:57] and so basically by. Having people tell you about their behavior from the past. Yeah. you're, it's a lot better indicator of what they will do in the future. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:07] We also know that memory is not the best. </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:06:10] Yeah. One of the interesting we do, for example, to predict whether you're a smoker or not has got a lot of personality traits linked to that.</p><p>what am most revealing questions that you could ask is, when you're growing up, did you cross the line much with, your family? Or your parents or school and the people that readily admit to that a 35% more likely to be a smoker. Cause it's, you can understand where that's coming from, they'll push things.</p><p>And one of the things they went into what they ended up smoking it on the back of that. And then that's a good example of how. a small facet of your personality can have quite significant implications to your life. In a sense. We also discovered that we were always, if you ask people, how could you use job?</p><p>Everyone's better than average. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:02] Yeah. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:07:04] Yeah. </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:07:07] If, but if I were to say. Can you point someone in your document? If are you compared to your brother? I might be a little bit more prepared to admit that I'm quite well all compared to near-field family members. I can be a little bit more honest about who. You know what I'm actually like then the general, what we found is that by asking people to think about themselves in the context of real, tangible people, they know their family, they were, again, they were able to be a bit more honest.</p><p>and I think the biggest leap forward was when we started to break down the problem into little bite sized chunks. So I'm not gonna say I'm disorganized, but I might prepare to admit that my bedroom door. Drawers are a bit messy. and I might, I could ask you, when did you do the washing up straight away or do you leave it a bit, or I might say how you park, do you just drive straight in or do you think about it in reverse park, in, those tight, those little we can be honest about those and in themselves, they're not going to be, it's been unfair to it.</p><p>Doesn't feel like it's. Honestly, I feel like it's personal. Yeah. Those tiny little clues together. And you get actually quite a more reliable assessment or so much calls in each. And so what we did was literally we deconstructed every one of the big, say the big five personality traits. Literally we tested out for each of those personality dimensions.</p><p>We tested hundreds of behavioral based little indicator type questions. And then we did technical principal component analysis to pick apart and isolate the things that are most revealing of each the primary personality traits that people could answer my phone, honestly. And then the survey is made up of lots of little questions like that people ask quite enjoy answering in a funny sort of way, because you can just bring it to life a little bit more human based questions.</p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:09:10] if you get a question, do you park right in the front or. Backwards. It's like, why could they ask this? I have no idea what they can conclude from this, but actually you can, </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:09:20] if you edit it tiny little clue, you can over-interpret some of these things. And so that was one nice breakthrough that we were able to really demonstrate that we could be a bit more rounded.</p><p>And then what we discovered is that, How many questions did you answer? we took </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:09:37] a hundred thousand </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:09:39] for the big five personality traits. There's five primary person. I think we did five over, more than four. We probably did about 20 experiments. And we might test out a batch of 50 or 70 questions for each of them, and then you whittled them down and it would be literally AB testing in a sense, you'd be testing out all these different approaches then working out, which is the most reliable, which is the most comprehensive.</p><p>There's lots of subtleties to it because a lot of these questions you realize how dominated your white Western sort of humanity. You're my perspective on the world. We want you to, we want you to develop a test that works in lots of different languages and lots of different cultures. And we first rough of our questions, how all his stuff about recycling, because we discovered really revealing about your levels of conscientiousness, how, whether you can be bothered the cycle, it's actually a really good indicator.</p><p>And then we test. Is it, our insurance different countries discovered the, in most parts of Asia, no one recycles. And so you can't that those questions are precluding. Yeah. And when you discuss, when you deconstruct a lot of the personality tests, scarily American, Western culture bias, the questions just simply don't translate across culture.</p><p>So there's </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:54] one level of psychology or social </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:10:57] Eastern week. There was one particular element of a personality. It's measuring people's attitudes towards risk taking, and you take a lot of the refugee control. You take a lot of the classical tests and you start looking at the questions. What should I choose to whitewater rafting or, Skype diving.</p><p>And you can imagine a retired lady in Singapore asking her that just doesn't mean anything. So that was one of the challenges is trying to think. things that could transcend culture and were stable from one culture to another anyway, to tackle that and the other real, evolutionary stat we discovered is that if you, if you all these personality tests side by side, you start to realize that.</p><p>All lip interwoven. and the different cognitive thinking style techniques and different ways. So we think they're all, it's our brains have a mashup of lots of different factors. All these different tests, often have very similar questions. and what we discovered is that if. If you take out the constitute con the core constitutional parts of each personality framework you want to measure and measure them all side by side, they start to inform each other and you could use the results from one part of the test to validate another part of the test.</p><p>And when you start doing that, you might yeah. To say, to measure consciousness, I can actually validate it from maybe 20 or 30 data points from other parts of the personality. Framework questions. They start to introduce a degree of like blockchain style stability, because I'm not relying on one particular thing to determine your whole personality measures made up of lots of little ticks here.</p><p>So if one particular factor doesn't particularly cost culture that doesn't fall over my personality assessment. So what we found is by combining multiple measures into one survey actually gave us a great deal of stability and cross. Cross correlation around cultures was higher than we were finding with some of the traditional techniques.</p><p>So having a quieter, like an Uber measurement protocol, when we think about what we developed as a measure of essentially the big Fife, personalities, but, a range of cognitive thinking, style, fish, things like, locus of control. my sense of control. I feel have a, my life, and the people.</p><p>Have feel like they've got a lot of control over that I've actually tend to be slightly more conscientious as well. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:13:33] so is it like, you have a, I don't know what the English term is, but you have some, some things you can slide and if you slide deck one, a lot to the right then the other one automatically goes a little to the left.</p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:13:43] Yeah. The inter interrelated. Yeah. Everything. and we take every scrap of detail from just actually the way you use the system. &nbsp;is an indicator of certain personality types. So some people use the far a lot more enthusiastic in the way that these scales are. The people are very measured and that correlates with, regulatory control, risk takers tend to,</p><p>and they, and so those that metadata, we also weave into our assessments.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:23] about something else. Yeah, it looks, it's not about the questions itself. It's about how fast you answer or something that's from. </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:14:31] and then the final part of the story, as opposed to just the way that, we realized is that if you've ever taken a personality test, it's essentially 40 or 50, agreed to squeeze statements, it just drives you nuts off the wall and you get really bored doing it.</p><p>And what we were able to observe is after about the 10th time, you were asked to agree to sewage peoples. To patronize their answers and you start to lose concentration. And so what we put a lot of thought in is to how to keep people's attention, going over the court. So maintaining that, and what we did is we broke the survey up into what we call thinking chunks.</p><p>We're about three minutes of thinking and we theme them each in a sense around a sort of a construct. and then what we did is we're at the beginning of. We have, what's called a thought starter, something that would like arrests their attention a bit. So we have a, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:15:24] if you will, if you win a million euros.</p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:15:26] Yeah, exactly. Yeah. We actually have a question in the seventies. If you won a hundred thousand pounds, what would you rather take the money or get slightly more money and have it only a thousand pounds a month? Would you want them all the money up front or do you want to impede. And that's, it's a fun question to think about what, but actually does reveal people's speech of having protocols.</p><p>So we would have little questions like that. We had a question, it's the queen, and that was coming to tea. How long will it take to tidy up your house?</p><p>assessment. And then we would just call it a questions around that sort of theme about your house, your home or weapons. And, and then at the end of each little chunk, we give them live feedback about what we've learned. So you are this type of, little, we draw out this sort of flair, slider Scouts and visuals and stuff.</p><p>You're this type of person or that person. And so they, what they felt is it was. The effort each little bit, because they knew that they'd sought to learn that they were, that we can get something out there, find something out about themselves as they went through it rather than right through to the end was a bit too late to engage them.</p><p>And boy did that have an impact on improving concentration? We were able to do some tests control experiments, where we stripped out those elements of feedback. And we were, the people were giving feedback like that. We were seeing about a 40% increase in thinking time. Address overall. And so that was just so that the paper just tells all this, what we did, all these different techniques.</p><p>So many of the techniques that we did develop actually could be applied in all sorts of different dimensions of research. So I think that it was some good general learning. I think that's why people like the paper, cause everyone read it, take something out of it. It was just spin off methodology from the back of it.</p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:17:33] It does that imply that all the personality tests we have up til now are. Useless or very inaccurate. </p><p>yeah. Plus your </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:17:42] research showed up</p><p>to pin down the errors. They have to be long. And so they're inefficient, I'd say I wouldn't want to do, the big five, 40 years old, pretty well established, but I dimension the long form is it's 40 or 50 questions per personality. Simply impractical to do that at scale.</p><p>So it's more to do with the inefficiency that I think we've closed off. And because all those tests inherently have lots of, things I'm talking about, but just done in a slide &nbsp;</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:23] big five. So the skills you use are based on big sites. </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:18:27] more to tell about that, because what we realize is that, a lot of the big five.</p><p>Constructs are very academic and really don't translate very well into, commercial decision making. So what we did is we actually tried to transpose those measures in somethings a bit more commercial useful. So </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:44] let's find out during this phase, you might find out it's actually in those five dimensions, but six, four or four, </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:18:49] they didn't use the big five is just the architecture beneath that there's like loads of sub dimensions.</p><p>a good example would be, Openness. Now we did this project for Ogilvy. They were, they, they had a behavioral economic theory that, people who were trying to lose weight were one of the facets that they were open. and their reasoning was that they were open. Therefore, B if I say what you like a bar of chocolate, you say </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:19:18] yes.</p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:19:20] Okay. Now in actual fact, Openness. And the classical academic measure is a measure of intellectual curiosity. It's not quite the same as open to suggestion. No. And it </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:19:35] could be the opposite. </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:19:36] Yeah. And so those two things are being confused just by the language. And so what we realize is that a lot of the, these tests conscientious as well, it's like a general construct that actually has three independent variables, that are really important.</p><p>To understand the it's a confluence of fastidiousness Snus and the primary questions in the classical test ask things like, how could you spelling is? Yeah. But it's also about how goal-driven you are, which is different. I could be really goal-driven individual where I'm really conscious. I want it.</p><p>I'm going to win this thing. I'm going to go and do it. And. I leave a lot of mess along the way, and I'm not very fastidious about the detail. And then you've got another person who's, very careful about . That's a good, this is more focusing on the careful and doesn't take into account this group, people who in many respects, you'd look on them as being very conscientious.</p><p>They really work hard, who status stay in the office late, try and get things done, but they may rush over some data. And then there's another element of it, which is level of organization. And that doesn't necessarily, I can be very organized and therefore I don't have to rush to get, and that the result of that open, thinking about paying my bills on time and stuff like that.</p><p>So </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:02] just like it's in the old test, this is all self-reporting. So you're not actually a dusting out organized. Are you compared to</p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:21:17] So a measure of conscientiousness is almost useless for me as a market researcher. I need to know the sub facets of that to be able to do something with it. So what we are, our personality measurement framework is actually made up of the primary ones, but some sub dimensions that we think are important for market position, decision making.</p><p>So it's built around that language because everyone understands what the big five are, but we're actually. I'm more interested actually, in some of the sub dimensions, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:48] then the question is what can we do with it? as a commercial company we spoke yesterday with, was the gaming company, the first cytoma and, also, they had this two dimensional scale for, four images and other big image DataBank, and they have the different magazines.</p><p>So which image represents best or works best speaks to the audience of a certain new magazine. And. They create this machine slash DPI system, to use this huge DataBank of, images and put it in one of those four boxes, which fits a certain audience </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:22:24] or for certain, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:22:25] the basically help themselves and advertisers predict what image would work best on which, </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:22:30] yeah, exactly.</p><p>The same sort of idea is just to Ashley. we're talking to loads and loads of farm work where. You might show people different advertising messages and look at which personality groups, each message appeals to what you can see. It's quite distinctive differential appear between just subtle changes sometimes in a message have more resonant with more, different sub genres of people based upon their personality.</p><p>So what the way the root of the Ogilvy methodology for developing thing, any form of marketing. In communication. It's trying to understand the behavioral science of the decision and how people think about it, what and what the emotional roots to that process. And so the test measures that, so what they can do and do is apply theories to communication development, strategy development, and that's essentially where we've had some really great early wins in doing that.</p><p>And for example, we did this fantastic piece of work where we tried to deconstruct the person. Personality of people trying to give up smoking. And we, we identified some of the core group of people struggling to give up smoking had, the struggle to process emotions a bit. And that using smoking is a bit of a timeout for, an emotional break they're incredibly fatalistic.</p><p>They had &nbsp;there were, they controlled them. They didn't really control. They didn't have a sense that they could actually get. Give up smoking for that, with their own internal motivations. They've given up that they what's called an external locust of control. They felt that it should, that things would happen.</p><p>Yeah. They didn't have much I could do too. Okay. And then we also discovered that they were very, it was called promotional orientated and that they were only, they were, they had a sort of, it's not just risk taking is that they were so getting. Goal-orientated and a bit rebellious. that's the route of going into smoking.</p><p>It's got an association with rebelliousness and then the most critical thing was avoidance of negative emotion and that, and they, and the way they used smoking to process that. And then you start to look at your typical anti-smoking ad and it's just like a picture of someone dying of cancer. And we did some really interesting experiments where we show people, ads, just random ads.</p><p>And then we drop in one of these antiques. The key messages and compared how smokers and nonsmokers reacted to them. And essentially the non-smokers just click the next button. And we timed how long those look at them. And they were literally clicking the next button almost twice as of 50% faster than the smokers, because it was setting off alarm bells internally.</p><p>And so the way that we're dealing with those negative emotions is to blank out almost. And so these it's not say that those sorts of messages not effective for certain groups of people to encourage them to give up smoking. But this hardcore group of people are really struggling. I'm obsessed that and the way they do it's just Oh no.</p><p>Don't tell </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:25:28] me so the question is it's a good ad for non-smokers, </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:25:33] but it's a bad ass. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:34] Oh, websites we talk about at banner blindness is something you learn. Ignore. </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:25:40] So what we then to do, we trying to then build from the ground up and different approach to communicating the opportunity to give up smoking, around solutions around exploiting or called external locus of control reasons.</p><p>Bring up you're getting married or you've just had a grandchild. These are wonderful external motivators to give up smoking and showing people achieving that those, those moments in life where people were able to actually actively achieve giving up smoking seeds, the opportunity in their minds of someone.</p><p>And then for the capturing this idea that emotional orientated mindset we developed some messaging around. positioning, giving up smoking is a bit of a challenge that these people had overcome and fuck you. I gave up smoking, they're smoking, a really like the rebellious, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:26:30] but then the other way around </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:26:32] reverse engineer and then the fatalism of it all, we developed some messaging around tomorrow's the day sort of thing.</p><p>And then what we did exactly, same thing we showed people's selves about drop these ads in. And what we're finding is that non-smokers these are there were there where there's no reason. Just a different, but the smokers were pausing and looking at them and we realized that we were connecting, they were connecting.</p><p>And it's difficult to know whether it's a good example, of how by really understanding the underlying personality traits and the how people think it's a really brilliant starting point for developing better forms of communication. And really, I think that's, it says revolutionized is how you think about developing after the communication.</p><p>It's really what could they have really pioneered? And they really are pioneers of that methodology that they're ugly center for behavioral science is really driving forward their business. And what they hopefully this test does is it gives them a platform to be able to implement that more effectively by actually having a proper framework to measure a theory because they're up until now.</p><p>I have a construct. I need to be able to measure whether it's true or not. Before I press ahead with the spending. Money on the advertising. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:27:47] Sounds a bit like your chase chasing a moving target. Almost like with a, I think when I read the book from Erin Meyer about culture, what really resonated with me that said, okay, culture in itself, isn't something.</p><p>it's always relative to another culture. I think it's very similar with personality. Personality in itself doesn't mean anything unless you compare it to something else, those skills. And like you said, smoking's, relates to being rebellious, but I think 70 years ago </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:28:16] it was the norm. It was socially acceptable.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:20] So how often should you </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:28:21] be revising? I think that you could think about that. there's a whole area of situational relevance to some of this stuff as well, because My level of conscientiousness will vary. You know what I mean? The supermarket buying a washing powder. Yeah.</p><p>Compared to buying a car, my level of conscientious &nbsp;this, that's probably more significant situational. Factors and trying to understand the situational personality variance as much as in a sense that's what a time is. It's a situational factor in a moving decision making framework. the core personality traits, the same.</p><p>This time was 50 years ago, but the situation of buying and choosing cigarettes has moved on and therefore you need to understand that. Yeah. So it's really important to understand that the situation framework and what you're trying to measure, and then often what we do discovered that it's actually, these are personality test is a starting point.</p><p>You probably, sometimes I have to bolt on extra little things to understand a little. Other little facets. So for example, we've done a lot work in the healthcare sector. there's this thing called optimism bias. that, really dominant in your likelihood to take treatment options up seriously is literally whether you think you're invincible or not, whether you think that you're vulnerable to and it's, and you can see it with people's.</p><p>say for example, diabetic stage. Was it stage two diapers before they developed? </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:29:53] Yeah. One is before two is </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:29:55] when you can get rid of it, then yes. The early stages. And what you, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:00] luckily I don't know </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:30:01] if you, if you look at, measure people's optimism bias and that you can measure it with a cluster of questions, it correlates with their lightly.</p><p>Heard of actually taking the actions, don't think go out and doing some exercise or doing, responding to that thing. Yeah. In particular, we found that, personality is really important to us. How health care applications, likelihood of taking treatments and avenues for encouraging people to take up treatments there, the relationship with our emotions and how they respond to different types of messages.</p><p>Some people really block out emotional advertising messaging that are too strong. And other people respond to more the practical aspects of it. And they want solutions and other people that have a barrier to their confidence of getting over that first thing, the first step, they don't feel that.</p><p>So if you, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:30:48] that's fascinating. </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:30:50] So when applying this, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:52] for example, to buying behavior, When it's, when I give presentations and I talk about, you have also the experience of that person might very, have a big impact on their expert level of buying something. for example, I'm the experts of buying wine.</p><p>Maybe I'm very, influential. Being influenced by my, whatever my friends do or whatever I buy. I look at my friends first. Yeah. But when it comes to wine, I'm the expert. So please go away friends. You didn't know nothing about this and the wine experts. I'll tell you. I'm not going to listen to you anyway.</p><p>So how far his personality? A predictor for buying behavior. </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:31:33] how much </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:31:34] it's not going to be a hundred percent </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:31:35] obvious. One of the things we very specifically woven into our measure is, the sort of head or neck framework, which you make decisions. whether you're using your feelings to make decisions and what information you feel you need to make a decision we've retooled, raking three control.</p><p>It was a risk taking thing, actually that the questions we devised centered around how much information you need to make a decision. If you're buying a car, do you need to go and do some research also just go down to the showroom and jump in a car and see what feels nice. Yeah. But what you've just identified is one of the.</p><p>the sense of self confidence in your own knowledge and your decision making skills, and that will vary some people have a lot more self confidence. and it's one of the dimensions you mentioned this sort of it's called locust of control, your sense of self competence, your ability to make your own decision, which might be it's incredibly situational.</p><p>So if I recognize that I know a lot about a topic, I'll rely on my own opinion. And if I'm not, I then might be, am I the sort of person that would then seek advice or w or am I now the person that would want to go and still work it out for myself, but will take more time to work out. And there are so that's, you pinpointed without that bit of information.</p><p>In a particular buying scenario, I'm a bit blind. And so one of the things that I biggest frustrations with all forms of generic segmentation in the sense we've developed generic segmentation model, is that you cannot just rely completely on that generic, separate segmentation saying what all decisions couldn't be flown and predicted out of this.</p><p>You're always have to augment. with some extra things that are relevant situation relevance up to think. And I think you pinpointed what really good example of that? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:33:22] Yeah. It's the famous saying, all models are wrong, but some are useful. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:33:27] Yeah. Yeah. But I think </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:33:29] we're just, I'd like to think about these as lenses almost to look at Christian Christ.</p><p>That's his is his language. It's saying they're just lenses to look at the world. And give a different viewpoint of, of how to think about it. They're not answers. They're just like ways to look at people. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:33:45] Yeah. And I think it's also true that, I think you can reverse your example as well. So somebody who usually thinks he's an expert, but specifically on wine, he listens to his friends.</p><p>So as long as the buyer behavior lines up with, especially ways that with certain types you can optimize for it, or </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:34:04] at least try though. it's almost diverting a different feel, but I've done a lot of work on social influence. and you realize how significant that is. So social proof, social, the certain, in the past, you'd have fashion.</p><p>Things like haircuts and clothing. Yeah. music and stuff were deemed fashion driven and that's basically level of social exposure because I can see your heck. I can see a million people's haircuts every day. I know what's and so those markets were subject to fashion changes. Other things like, what wallpaper was in your living room?</p><p>I would not get me so exposed to that. It's only when I go around to your house, I get to see. And so those types of choices, they're also fashion driven, but because unlike exposure rate, To your house. And so the &nbsp;of the fashion is very low on that. There's the fashion cycles longer. And so you can actually plot it out.</p><p>The more social exposure, the more churn you get of choice, really. And then as you go down to something like boot, Polish, Where it sits in your cupboard. You only get it out now. There's no social context. Interestingly, the number one boot Polish brand a hundred years ago, it's still the number one boot Polish.</p><p>This is not be no social influence driving. There's no fashion in that. Now what's happened with, basically social media has opened up the house to social exposure. And also it's opened up drinking occasions to huge amount of social spaces. So now I'll post a picture of myself having a drink.</p><p>And what we've been observing is that I'm more, a lot more comfortable sharing a photo of a cool brand of beer. Then the regular brand of that. In fact, I did some analysis of, for example, whiskey. Yeah. if you scrape like a hundred photographs of whiskey off Instagram, and then you look at the top three or four brands of whiskey, you won't see the material in any of those.</p><p>They're all in the obscure little is not cool too. And so that's the essence of fashion is that it, no one wants to be mainstream. And so that. Fashion social influence is deacon's basically attack it, attaching all sorts of market sectors. That once was pretty stable. And so the beer market is turning fashion driven.</p><p>The light, the lifecycle of beer brands is dropping down to maybe five, six, 10 years to down to two or three. And maybe I think I suspect there's going to be faster and faster. And so I think that's a really good example of a new thing. You have to understand human decision making. It's the influence of the social context and how it invades, and particularly vulnerable to that really freaky things.</p><p>For example, we discovered dogs. I have a dog dogs, the number one, social media, accessory on </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:37:05] Instagram dogs or cats. </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:37:06] Yeah, exactly. Dog sales have gone up. If you actually look at, the rise of Instagram and the rise of dogs, I'm going to ship. Yeah. It's correlating. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:37:15] Oh, that's awesome. </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:37:18] That's </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:37:18] all depends on how well they're taking </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:37:21] care of dogs.</p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:37:21] Yeah. Freaky ones, Christmas decorations. In the old days, you have the Christmas decorations that you get out of your faith that is reading your family for generation. You put them on your Christmas tree. No one sees them about your family. Now, wherever you are. But you, can you take a photograph of me, next year I can't take a photograph of, I photographed that last year.</p><p>I needed a new Christmas decoration. So literally Christmas decoration sounds, I've literally just gone through they've climbed about 30, 40% year on year, the last few years, because. I decided to be able to show something new and fresh. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:37:54] My mom has the same color for 30 years, but she is not on Instagram.</p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:37:57] Yeah. </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:37:58] That's the thing. Anyway. Diversity. Yeah, presentation. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:38:05] What are you going to do research next? </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:38:08] where, I'm particularly, I talk to you about, at the beginning about that. The grumpy cat. Yeah. Yeah. we're in the midst of a whole load of experiments, looking at how to get people to be built, honestly, declare certain things like environmental attitudes and stuff, which really fascinating because some things like you asked you through was, recycling and so on.</p><p>If you ask people straight up, do you do these things? What you feel about this? Would you do this in supermarket? Everyone says yes. yes. And it's not true. And so we've been doing a whole lot of experiments, try and understand how to moat Pete motivate people, to be more honest, actually about.</p><p>Their behavior and what they would do in different situations using. And I've got a fantastically smart intern working for me. And who splits, you spent the last few weeks digging up these really wacky sort of Mimi type visuals. If I just tried to test it, if I had this fantastic animated meme of this woman.</p><p>Going to throw a bag of rubbish into the recycling bin and she swigs it around and it breaks just as this way, but it all spreads all over like that. And we'll use that as a, sort of the start of a dialogue. we always face someone's face challenges, recycling. Tiny bit of humor, literally doubles the amount of people who then prepare to open up a meant that they don't bother recycling.</p><p>We'd be doing a lot of fun with that. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:39:32] So you're just, you're still gonna keep on basically improving what you found to make </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:39:38] it better. We're looking at, one of the other is, income. Everyone says in the survey that they're rich </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:39:45] or. </p><p>Jon Puleston: [00:39:45] everyone inflates their wealth as wealth questions in their Heights.</p><p>It has no correlation with wealth. Almost certainly no correlation with disposable income. So what we'd be looking at using the same idea of behavioral techniques, we've been trying to work out. How do you measure thinking about how to measure someone's disposable income by their behavior? So for example, Did you take a pack lunch into work or do you go out and buy it is a subtle tell about your level of disposable income.</p><p>So try and piece by piece to get that type of thing. So that taking that thinking and applying it different way to different challenge. It's something that we're looking at. At doing, we've had lots of spinoff methodologies come out of this work. So I'm just like exploring different. </p><p>‍</p>",,bdde0c88

Like for example, eight, 10% lift in conversion rate. </p><p>Daniel: [00:00:36] If they, if they give you, Well goals like that. Then you, you, as an agency, you should say, well, okay, but then the way we're going to reach that, that will be our decision.</p><p>Because if you also say, we need to do that with five tests every month, and you have to do that in 10 hours, every test, and you can't guarantee that kind of results. So well also in your sales, you need to balance that kind of challenges of what your clients want and also manage the expectations.</p><p>Because, yeah, I stay one both and it will not go, it's not going to work, but that's mostly, basically the two kinds of flavors that you can sell. You either sell a results or you, you sell just work and, yeah. And, and, and, and that's also how you organize. </p><p>Guido: [00:01:22] Yeah. So we have, we have very similar to it.</p><p>Typically we try to understand what the. What the goal is that the client has, they will normally come to us saying we want to increase our conversion rate and that's as detailed as they get. So we try to interrogate that, that goal to understand, is it, do they really mean revenue or profit or a profit per user, whatever the metric is.</p><p>We look to understand that. Then we try to define, are there specific targets that they, as a company have to achieve within the next six months or 12 months so that we can align our work today's because then exactly like Daniel says often they will have an idea in their mind of what they want. But typically that is not necessarily what they need.</p><p>And so it's our, our role as the agency to, to partner with them, to help them better understand that. And I think there's always that challenge between, so we have maybe, I don't know, there might be a potentially a third time, which is you've got the delivery clients who want, we want X experiments per month.</p><p>You have the target clients where we want to hit this target. And the rest is up to you. And the third type of ones where we would partner with the client to essentially augment their. Experimentation team. And that means that we can do the delivery work. We can do the performance work, but other random stuff comes up, you know, price experimentation, for example, that may not necessarily fit into any of the other brackets.</p><p>And we can support on that as well. So that's, that's the ideal time, because that way we can direct our work. to the requirements of the business and then set kind of quarterly targets that we want to achieve. And then also worked for clients that want to do this in house. Right. So that they can do within us.</p><p>They're just missing some skills. You can augment that. </p><p>Daniel: [00:02:56] Yeah. There's one thing. There's one thing I want to add there. Whenever a client comes to you with whatever well, and to have we, we always have some kind of hidden agenda in our, in our mind to get them more mature, because it's, like you said, in the beginning of your question, that it's a process where you were, were you looking for, Some, some genuine increasings, to, to, to their results.</p><p>And of course, when they, I come to you very immaturely and they say, yeah, we want five tests a month because, well, somebody told us that that's the kind of philosophy we can reach then. And so that's what we need. And of course we all know here that that philosophy itself will not get you any results.</p><p>You need some sophistication in it and just. And for the sophistication, you need time and trust. And that's what we always try to do also with our clients to, to work on their maturity. And it's just something you do in everything that you deliver with them, that you also help them in getting more mature, because then you can get more results in the longterm and that's the way to grow it.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:04:08] Omar, did you have a second question? Yeah, actually I forgot two more time to think about it. without putting me on the spot, but, so starting out, you probably had a lot of challenges yourself. I can phrase it two times or two ways, but let me do this. what would be the best advice you would give yourself?</p><p>If you could go back in time to say, okay, don't do this again. That's the first question. And also you guys have grown your businesses pretty big. does it get better? I growing it because I see there, I spoke with a lot of you guys and I see that there's a tendency to, okay. Maybe if I go to 15 or go to 20, I go to 30.</p><p>If I scale a bigger and bigger, it will be better because are you saying they look tired? No, I'm just, I'm just asking. So it get better. Does it get, what would we, the best advice as well? So sorry. W w would be the advice would you give herself? Okay. Let's do it. Does it get better? It gets different.</p><p>Like, I mean, you purely in terms of cash, I made more money when it was just me. Then when this company of 25 plus people, does that mean it's worse now because it's good, fun working with a team of people and seeing them do good work. so does it get easier? Some things get easier and like, you don't have to do, like when it gets to a certain scale, there are some things that you can just give to other people, finance, HR, things like that, that I don't really enjoy doing.</p><p>And then let other people handle that. So that's certainly gets easier, but then the problems get difficult. I think the biggest challenge, if you've got an agency with any number of people, is that you're not, like I said, a minute ago, your, your wage bill, the amount that you have to pay each month will stay.</p><p>Typically the same or will go up, but then clients can bounce around. And so that can be the biggest headache, you know, a couple of clients or a couple of wins either way can make quite a big difference. And in terms of, if there was one thing that I would change, or one piece of advice that I would give one to myself, I think, so it can motion like.</p><p>Start the year. I think we're close to 40 people. We're now close to 25. So we had to do a restructure. earlier this year, this year, I think it was something that was affecting a lot of the agencies in the UK, Nicholas nodding, her head. so the challenge that we faced at design was with essentially built up cash reserves in the business so that we could, allow for something like that.</p><p>So if we did have a period when we were making a loss and we wouldn't have to kind of jump. Too early. and so we absolutely did the right thing there. I think the one thing that we didn't do was we don't know, we got a little bit complacent, I think. so there were some changes that we should have made a lot sooner in terms of the, like the structure of the business.</p><p>and the people that we're hiring. I think we let a few things, go that maybe I didn't pay enough attention to myself. I think I'd stepped back a little bit from too much of the day to day. And I think it was an easy mistake to make, because when you're running, when you've got, I don't know, a 2 million pound a year wage bill, you have to focus on sales because if you don't, then that's not going to come in.</p><p>But I think we have to get the right balance. So, we took the company back to being a little bit smaller of a 25 people and now in a much, much better place. And we are being much more cautious in terms of hiring both because we don't want to hire the wrong people because of the effect that that can have on the rest of the business.</p><p>But secondly, also, because we don't want to commit to that ongoing. Salary, unless it's fully justified. So I'd much rather use freelance or contract until we get to the point that we've got enough visibility on the requirement of the requirements of the business longer term that we can afford to hire that person.</p><p>Alright. Would you give yourself a different advice, Daniel? </p><p>Daniel: [00:07:47] Yeah. It's an interesting question. And since, and it's very hard to answer. It's an excellent question. Yeah. It's yeah, it's an excellent question. It's I couldn't raise it better. the, the most important thing is that you stay true to yourself.</p><p>And, and what happens is, is, well, I know you a little bit and you're, it's similar. You just like your work, then you, you, you put in the extra mile for your clients that's then they reward you with more work and then suddenly you think, Oh, I can handle it myself. And then you hire somebody and that's a very big step, but then suddenly, well you hire somebody more and more and more, and then you are an agency and that's how it started.</p><p>And well, we are now with more than a hundred people and, and it's, it's way above my head because I'm still this analyst and I just love data. And the main, main reason I always want bigger clients is that it gets more interesting data sets. And, and I also think, I think that that's getting interesting data sets and interesting clients.</p><p>It's interesting for the staff that we hire and that's why they want to stay with us. So that's how I regard it. It's just a game for me, that sentence. and, and, and I can't control it anymore and not myself, but a thing. I did this, I always surrounded myself with people that, like the things that I think are important.</p><p>And I don't like, so I don't like finance. I don't like. HR, or I like HR, but somebody told me I'm very bad at it. And so then I thought, well, probably hire somebody for it. And that's also how I grew the business. So I always thought, well, okay, if I hire these people around me that do all these essential things, it enables me to, to stay true to what I like and love.</p><p>And that's also what keeps me going. Or get me out, gets me out of bed in the morning and directs me to work, or it doesn't direct me. I go there because I really like it. So </p><p>Guido: [00:09:52] what hiring people is that the only way to go? I mean, you could also use different freelancers. </p><p>Daniel: [00:09:58] Sure. It's just surrounding yourself with people, but hiring is, is, well, it's a way to cooperate, but of course, surrounding yourself or share your sheriffs is also a way of getting together with people.</p><p>And of course, yeah. Well with some people, well, I shared my sheriffs and with some people I hired them. That's, that's how we grew the business. And, but what I always looked at, how do these cook people? Well, that surround me, compliment me in, and I was very fo &nbsp;cused on, on that. I could continue doing what I love, because if I can't do what I love, I'm very unmotivated.</p><p>That's a, so to keep the motivation, I always. Keep that focus. And I think that's a very important aspect. And that's you, you're also vulnerable in it. Well, sorry. I honestly say I can't do these things. I don't like them. I'm very bad at them. Of course. That's sometimes very hard to say because she, Oh, you also have to admit it you're lazy or clumsy or whatever.</p><p>And of course, yeah, well, everybody, that's a vulnerable thing. So, but I think it's important, that you do that sometimes. So that's an advice that I give. And another advice is that when you are in doubt about starting something and engagement, like hiring somebody, or let yourself be hired by clients and you have any doubts, stay true to them and don't do it unless you really, really have to.</p><p>But whenever I had doubts about somebody, it always turned out wrong in the end. And because I did it because yeah. Then you rationalize like, Oh yeah, but it will work out. And I really need this kind of guy or girl, or I really need this client now because it will enable us to do so. And so with the money, it's always turned out wrong.</p><p>So stay true to yourself and it's easier said than done, but it's been </p><p>Guido: [00:11:51] stay true to yourself. Omar, next question. Ali has a question or. I had a quick one. do you do revenue sharing with your customers when you get to certain goals or not? So we don't do, we don't do pure revenue share. As in, if you do X, we do.</p><p>Y what we do is we'll use B because that can, that can change the nature of the work that we do. We will do performance-based deals where we might have a gateway in place where we will hit this chart, this target, and then it will trigger it. A longer engagement, for example, because it, revenue share like the challenge with that is it's not, it sounds good upfront, but then when you do the work, the client, they want to do, they want to dictate the experiments that you run.</p><p>You want to have complete ownership of that. It also means that you can't do anything that doesn't correlate to the goals that you set originally. And often it means that you spend more time doing due diligence on each individual experiment, as opposed to actually just doing more, more good work. I th I think everyone's advising against doing a revenue share.</p><p>they're there except Danielle. but I do see, well, full revenue share. At least there are some there's some hybrid models. </p><p>Daniel: [00:13:04] Yeah. I think you're you're right when it's only CRO it, it never works out because if you're doing too well and somebody, your clients has to pay you a hundred thousand euros for 10 hours of work.</p><p>Well, they do with once and then they're gone. So, so then it doesn't work, but we do revenue share for a comp for clients that outsource their full online marketing function to us. And then for instance, we work on that. We say, well, we get so many percentage of your revenue. And then we that's our share and we, we, we, we deliver hours for it, hours of work.</p><p>And then of course we can invest in growing the business. And then of course, when the business doubles also the, the amount of, of, management failure for us, the doubles as well. And that goes very well. And then it don't care anymore, whether we spend it in, in, in, starting some new channel or. increasing the philosophy of zero tests and also the, we don't report on the CRO tests.</p><p>They only want to see the lift and they also don't care how we did it because they don't want to learn from it. They just want to grow and then it works. But if it's only zero, of course, yeah. We have equally bad experience with it and we don't do it. </p><p>Guido: [00:14:18] Any more questions. Go ahead. Hi, Nuria from Google here.</p><p>I have like a two part question. So the first one is I've been talking to a lot of agencies in Nordics and Benelux, and I have three findings, and I want to know if you concur with those and then the second part would be kind of your wishlist. so it's kind of an interesting thing, but, cope with me.</p><p>So, so the first thing is, agencies across Nordics and Benelux have been telling me. that they have a problem in terms of how their visibility is shown towards different stakeholders within companies. So it's very difficult to quantify, you know, what are we doing? It's all these failed experiments.</p><p>Why are you paying us? secondly, it would be like in terms of dashboards, like how do we, yeah, go about KPIs, et cetera. And it has to do with the awareness of clients that they will just come to you and give you maybe a very vague, brief. So how, what can we do as, you know, as a company like Google to increase this awareness around, right.</p><p>KPIs, and then thirdly, I think it's all about, about how you sell yourself. so, so what kind of upsell cross sell etc of your own services? Could you actually be, positioning within these companies? And so those are kind of like three major issues there and, I'm new in my position at Google and we're looking at things that we can do to train.</p><p>people doing CRO worldwide. So it's kind of an ask of like, what things do you see that are gaps and what you would wish that you had training in? So if we take the first one, the, which I think was about visibility as, and how do you get the visibility within the client? Yup. You're absolutely right.</p><p>That's there's a problem that our industry faces in that, I guess it was what I was talking about a little bit earlier. People think that what we do is kind of tweaking and landing page or finessing. The finished product and we just kind of Polish it a little bit at the end. if that's the perception, then obviously no, one's going to give a shit about that within the company.</p><p>Instead that the first one that I made today was like, you should focus on the biggest problems that the company faces as in, if you can find out, like some of the stuff that we do at the moment on price testing. So we were experimenting on two different types of pricing, for example, or experimenting on products or essentially something that the business is going to care about.</p><p>You find out what does the CC in this company care about? What are the investments they're making? What are the risks that they're, that they're taking and then test around that, then it's a completely different method because you don't have to kind of push your, we tested this landing page and this is what will happen when we move the image from here to there.</p><p>No one gives a shit about that. If you say. We we tested five potential new products. One of them converted 50% higher than another. Do you want to load, do you want to see what the results were? Everyone is going to care about that. So I think the first one, the most important thing is to test about what people care about.</p><p>And obviously that's going to be much more meaningful for the business anyway. </p><p>Daniel: [00:17:06] Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Share the results because most people in, in, in larger companies that the web is only a small part of it. So. Yeah, we encounter the same things. And this is a way to get attention in a way. The problem that you you mentioned is, is more general because it's, it's the entire digital marketing, discipline or functioning in an organization.</p><p>So I also see that there's too little attention for that. So if they don't care about digital marketing, they also don't care about the optimization of digital marketing. And if they don't have a tradition of experimental approach to decision making, then they don't care about our experiments. It just the waste of time, because it distracts them of the, of their focus and their speed.</p><p>So sometimes it's it's way too, too, too hard to, to conquer that. It just takes a lot of time and trust. And you, you need to have some successes and the successes will get you your moment at the table. And then they suddenly think, Hey, yeah, that brought in a significant amount of money. And then you get your, your sheriff attention.</p><p>Guido: [00:18:21] One question that you can ask is, we often ask this during the kickoff that we have with the new client, which is, if you could test anything on your website or about your business, what would it be? And they normally start with some Fetty tame, mediocre answer, like. Oh, I redesigned the basket page or something like that.</p><p>But then if you try, if you actually push them and say, like, if you had a parallel universe where you could do whatever you wanted to about the business and nothing would matter, like what would you test then? And that's when you start to get these more interesting ideas and then you think, Oh, actually this one, we could probably test something around that and test something fairly simplified, but still meaningful.</p><p>And then building the, start building the mindset around that. I would also argue that as long as Google AdWords is still effective and bringing in a lot of money, they people are, the companies are not really incentivized to spend money on that conversion. I dunno, like we so often when we, when we start working with a new client, they, it's not like they have in line in their budget for conversion optimization.</p><p>So normally the way that we will often start working within Yukon is we will take budget from their Google ad spend. And then we will generate our own budget. We we'll pay that back within four to eight weeks and then we will grow it from there. That's going to go over great with the Edwards team, but it makes them more money eventually.</p><p>Daniel: [00:19:37] Yeah. But that's something where Google can, can make a change because what happens now is it's the way your AI is, is basically making a human management less and less important. The next step in, in managing Edwards accounts become integrating CRO and Edwards because the bid management and the keyword select we'll be done automatic.</p><p>So the only thing that a human can do to optimize results is put in proper CRO and it's it's it's landing page optimization, matching between ads and landing pages and that sort of thing. And you can educate your clients in it. You can educate agencies in it. And of course, yeah, we can educate their own stuff.</p><p>But also when more people in, in, in companies that do advertising know about this, then it will be much easier to shift this, this budget because yeah, the, the, the reluctance that you just indicated is really there. People really love their budget. And when we say, yeah, but if you spend 1% and we get a 1% lift in a month, then the other 11 months of your yearly budget, we'll add 1% extra, which probably won't do it with, with keyword management or anything.</p><p>So that's something you could do. </p><p>Guido: [00:20:53] A lot of ideas here, I think. Thank you so much, Danielle. Thank you so much, Steven. Thank you for, for all the questions. I do have one final question, for, for Steven though, you were now conference formerly known as conversion hotel. I think you can see where this is going.</p><p>You have conversion.com. Yes. Are you now considering changing your name to just, just to load logo, formerly known as conversion.com or something like that? I think I've got to stick with it. You can stick with it. Good. Thanks everyone. See you back tomorrow at two o'clock and if I'm correct, the bar should be open now.</p><p>So have fun having a good evening.</p><p>‍</p>",,d415454d

Yes. Okay. I don't speak Spanish. So Goma SAS. Yeah. Okay. I understand that one. Welcome. You just had a session. Could you shortly introduce yourself? </p><p>WeiWei: [00:00:18] Sure. I'm wary. I'm working at Google for the GFC product and I'm the solutions lead on JT 64. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:00:26] Yeah. And you just had a keynote, before, after lunch, that's </p><p>WeiWei: [00:00:30] about, you don't want to be the avant, sitting between you </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:00:34] exactly </p><p>WeiWei: [00:00:36] the audience </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:00:37] or your session was about very relevant and something.</p><p>a lot of us might be a bit scared. Scary or scared about, or maybe, yeah, or just blocking and ignoring, acting on your analytics data in an increasingly calculus world. So please tell us about that. </p><p>WeiWei: [00:00:56] I think I was three weeks ago on the dmexco and half of the sessions, actually it was about calculus world.</p><p>I think it's a very relevant topic right now, especially since the launch of the new ETP and ITP. So I think, this is why this topic might be relevant for people would be interested in, so this is the reason why we chose this. Yeah. And, but still, we were going to still be relevant to the user and that's Google always puts the user first.</p><p>Yep. in my, keynote, I wanted to open up new ideas for what you can do still to be relevant to the user. And yeah. Rather than in a way that you can still do something and, The worst would be like going back to the eighties and just have, tailored messages shouting at you, right?</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:38] Yeah. the MOA, the organization buying the conference today, they're already 80 years </p><p>WeiWei: [00:01:43] old, so </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:45] they already existed before we had internet. No, I learned that today two </p><p>WeiWei: [00:01:51] 80 years ago. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:54] it's marketing insights, research and, analytics. so more in general. Yeah. But more for magazines or for companies that do marketing in general.</p><p>Of course. of course we will have the luxury today that we have much more data. Yeah. You just </p><p>WeiWei: [00:02:07] forget about this. that advertising also existed offline. Yeah, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:12] we did. We didn't invent AB testing. They already did that before with magazines. </p><p>WeiWei: [00:02:17] I just came out of the Getty, was doing the, a session here just right now.</p><p>And, and she's saying about, how old people are actually also do buy online and that you don't wrap your head of it, but her 90 all's, mother's actually ordering clothes online and tries them on. And I was like, yeah, actually, why not? Makes sense, right? You don't, you're not so flexible anymore.</p><p>You don't physically, these, this is not a typical bucket group. You think of people who are using online shopping. So I was quite refreshing </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:46] to have the thought. Yeah, that's a great example. So today of course we talk about women and analytics is a, is also a topic today. And diversity is a great topic again, for a second of your users that you might not think of as might be very relevant.</p><p>it's </p><p>WeiWei: [00:03:00] not only closing the gender gap, but also the. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:03] Yeah, yeah, gender is just one of the dimensions you can score people on, but, there are a lot of, we spoke about age, when you're in eCommerce, there's probably a big difference between people that already did a purchase already our clients, or are still exploring.</p><p>we spoke to Transavia airline, trying to create a different experience for people that bought something. I bought a ticket or people that, they already bought a ticket and they're leaving in two days. They probably want a different experience. They wouldn't want to check in or something.</p><p>Or, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:03:27] if physical shops are near you, there are so many ways to segment and to, to make sure that you have the right audience and you're not biased in any way. </p><p>WeiWei: [00:03:37] exactly. Yeah. Again, the relevance for the user and yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:40] Yeah. Yep. Yep. so back to your talk. Yeah. How do we. Create that relevance in more and more calculus worlds.</p><p>WeiWei: [00:03:47] so there's yeah, I try to spot like the easy opportunities, low hanging fruits, easy solutions would be go through Google audiences where you have already audited. I built me to just select them demographics, affinity in market. Then of course you can use your first party data. So the best way to measure anyway is that you, use tools which put cookies on the same domain as a website, right?</p><p>So it was first party data, and they are also less effected by the changes. the legal and technical changes, and the third party cookies. and the third one actually is about cloud solutions. And what other signals we can use. Which are out of the box thinking. I, we had some case studies shown up there where, for example, you can use this a great case study, which actually won also.</p><p>It bronze a lion in Canada this year. the tariff tracker. So it's, they used a lot of data from medical, institutes. They had weather data, social data, search data, and a lot of data points that could create basically a model which predicted in which one of the 32 different districts in Mexico with the flu will break out and show relevant ads in that region.</p><p>The temperature with the likelihood, of, and it's awesome because it is taking data points outside of the cookie world. But then how powerful is that you see, even in a moment where he gets sick or even before you get sick, like the predicts already that you, that this app could be relevant for you.</p><p>and using machine learning, which is the Google cloud machine learning, which can predict this. And, and then use GMP the Google market platform to actually activate on that. for example, having, and then creators where it puts automatically different, parts of the creative. So for example, the background of the city, you are in the temperature, you are facing red now using and elements of that in one creative.</p><p>And I'm doing, I think it was 250 different versions of the ad, with a very low budget. I think the whole campaign was only costing 200 cakes. I'm just very low on cost. And if you think about this of solution five years ago would cost probably 10 times. No, there wasn't anything like that before and yeah.</p><p>This easy pieces of Google cloud platform together with the Google marketing platform. I think this is very powerful. because Justin just cut machine power behind that. just, if you think about this kind of things, 10 years ago, people said, Oh, it's the future, but it's not possible yet. We are in the future now where this kind of things are possible and it's even very easy to start with.</p><p>So I think this is a, the last piece which I talked about in terms of solutions or cloud solutions or using Google cloud API. a vision API where we can, for example, we had a case study with Unilever in Indonesia that, during Ramadan, they were looking at all the pictures in Instagram and they looked at the different, products like food, and they could use the most popular food in there, directly in the eighth graders and saying, you're looking for the other cookies here.</p><p>We have a good recipe for you. And I think this kind of things is very powerful because it uses much more data from the outside world. And not too much on not relying too much on the cookie based pay data. Yeah. and also I think one important part, if we look at the future and we talk about the future in the sense of how can technology help me staying relevant to a user, how can I still measure, plan optimize on data?</p><p>Then we definitely need to talk about the new app and buy properties in Google. so I also showed a bit of what we can do. It's an open beater. So we encourage everyone to use that and to give us feedback as well. And, this is also something which we really invest a lot into from the Google analytics side.</p><p>So this is definitely our vision of the future. And, we will also look into this. Much more in 2020. So I showed also a couple of, features we're planning. It's like bit the roadmap. We are planning what we can expect 2020 to bring for the alphabet properties. this was also definitely a topic, at the end of my, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:08:04] and, does it also integrate in some way with </p><p>WeiWei: [00:08:06] YouTube?</p><p>It will integrate with so we are building that product upon, Firebase, modeling and everything we have in a product right now, we try to also bring into the new product. So whatever we have on, GA classic on the web and on five is for app. we know which features are popular, which are needed.</p><p>we will also definitely looking into the degration of all this products into. The new app of our properties. For example, next year we have we plan definitely to bring in eCommerce, the integration with, DV three 60 as a three 60 cm is definitely also in the plans of, the next two years.</p><p>And, we gonna, yeah, look into big query integration. we will talk about &nbsp;all of the, so it's, it's very exciting to be part of the whole story and to yeah. To see what the future brings. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:57] Is there any known, period for the beta? Is that the ending. is there, </p><p>WeiWei: [00:09:03] we just try it to get as many people as possible on it now, so just have to learn.</p><p>Exactly. So also part of the new trend words are AI machine learning, all of this, but I'm taking one step back. What does it actually, what is machine learning? What is AI? It can predict, it can make decisions. Millions of physicians, in a minute where you monumentally probably not be able to do. And it learns three examples.</p><p>But yeah. That therefore we need data a lot of, and also not alone, the quantity of data, but also the quality of data. So we need as many people as possible to just, try it out and we can learn from that and make it better. And then that's where we are at a stage right now. So this is why it's an open beat term.</p><p>Everyone can just start on it. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:09:45] Nope, no restrictions in, how many visitors your site or short meet or </p><p>WeiWei: [00:09:49] no? And half the tagging in place. And also if you are doubting of what we can do with, cause you have already a very good property and on your whiteboard, and you. Yeah, you think about, okay, I don't want to retake.</p><p>you can always do dual tagging dual taggings, what we recommend. So that's something we can start off already. So that's available right now. So you can do it today, tomorrow. Exactly. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:12] That's definitely something that we all need to look in. And also we had just pulled out another, keynote speaker.</p><p>Telling us. Yeah, this is going to be the future. So I don't know why everything we should just ditch universal. </p><p>WeiWei: [00:10:25] it's, as I said, there's still some functionality lacking, so we know that. So this is why we don't say </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:31] this. </p><p>WeiWei: [00:10:32] That's why it's a beta. Exactly. So for example, e-commerce is not there yet.</p><p>So I think this is a big part of, Of the strategy of a lot of clients. And that's definitely something which you should keep doing, and you should not throw away this, but the move, which is upcoming, you should have it in the back of your mind. You should not forget about us. And if possible, stat testing that out with a small branch of your company or with a little sub group of, of a business, because that is easier.</p><p>If you do ready the first baby steps. Then it's easier to at some point switch, to add </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:11:03] 20, 20 sounds like a good year to take the first baby steps. </p><p>WeiWei: [00:11:07] Definitely. Yes. Yes. So 2020 is definitely a year of changes for Google as well. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:13] and we had, several guests today talking about data, quality, how I'm still, that is for many.</p><p>Companies. we might feel, we need to get out of that stage. We should get out of that stage. But </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:11:24] I think it's that way in a lot of, digital fields. with, with search marketing, we also feel like we can do a lot of things, but still a lot of companies don't have the basics set up properly to get the maximum out of it.</p><p>And I think, Euro is no exception to that. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:42] Yeah. And even previously with, or currently with, Google, and there's universal. you still need to manually add events, That might be partially resolved at least with, the new solution. but still a lot of people using universal.</p><p>Yeah. You still need to. Some manual work. If you want to measure what's relevant for you and how to optimize for it. we have a podcast about optimization. You need to base that </p><p>WeiWei: [00:12:06] on </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:07] good day data. </p><p>WeiWei: [00:12:09] Definitely, but also just keep in mind, like the way we track with Google analytics. It is a structure, which has been over 10 years on the market.</p><p>And like at that moment when it was launched, it wasn't, there wasn't even an iPhone. There wasn't a smartphone in the world. So think Apple X, like the first smartphone was 2007 or so end of 2007 </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:29] apples here, maybe. </p><p>WeiWei: [00:12:30] Yeah. So I think it's yeah, but I remember when I was in university, we had Noah, like it came basically around.</p><p>Yeah. No, it wasn't school. There was no smartphone. And I think this is what we sometimes forget how fast paced everything is that, that smartphones only existence 12 years. And that was not thought through in that moment when it didn't exist.</p><p>So a lot of things change and we need to adapt to the change and change our systems with it. So we definitely think that we're going away from the session based. Thinking to more user based thinking. So this is like something which is still ingrained because yeah, that moment of time when it started to be you important, and we had only sessions, We had hits and sessions only, and now we're moving away from that and having a model. But this is something which is ongoing this change of environment and the adaptation towards it. This always, who was one step ahead, right? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:24] Yeah. Yeah. And we had a, yeah, like we just start with MOA. They already exist for 80 years, but in digital we have so much more data and we can do so much more with that.</p><p>And like things like machine learning or AI, we have, we now have the data to do that, but we have to grow up fast, to actually do something useful with it and handle the data and they get it correctly. </p><p>WeiWei: [00:13:45] Yeah. It's not about only gathering, but what do you do with that? how can you make smart decisions upon that?</p><p>And, yep. I think this is also the inspirational part, which I've wanted to bring in that. just giving examples of how it can be used and how people actually use that. And maybe people go away with no design inspiration and create something else themselves for themselves. Yeah. The next step. And </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:14:07] I'm wondering, because you described basically a campaign that costs about 200 K you said, is it Google's goal to reduce.</p><p>The cost of such a campaign, like as fast as possible. it's much as much companies as possible can use it or is that, </p><p>WeiWei: [00:14:24] Oh, it's always about the user or in this case also the customer. So it should be something you think it's useful for you and it can bring them out most outcome for you, either as an advertiser or as a user.</p><p>so yes, it is in the sense that you make it most profitable for your company. And, You can talk to as many people about your great product you have in the best way. reached the right person at the right time. yeah. In the best manner you can do. and this is something which. I think if you see this kind of ad, you won't feel offended or something that is, Oh, this is great, actually.</p><p>So it's just helpful for me as a user, as I see this ad, but also helpful for the advertiser because he can make smarter decisions and, giving everyone, this information basically by predicting it, he can add actually this information towards. His, yeah. To his database of users. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:15:16] but is there like a timeframe, for when your local butcher shop can, can use something like this right now, right?</p><p>Yeah. in theory right now, but when it's a cost effective for them as well, is there a timeframe? </p><p>WeiWei: [00:15:30] I don't, obviously there's is also individual physicians and really knew it definitely. I think in smaller countries like Netherlands, of innovation happening already, which I think are fantastic.</p><p>You have a lot of data already, which is online available for, even if I move my house. in other countries, like in Germany, you would have to go to five different, different, Town halls to say I moved and then you have to talk to your electricity provider to a turbine provider, et cetera.</p><p>But Netherlands, I move and it's on my DG ID and it's actually, my insurance is updated. My, like gas bills updated. It's like a lot of things are much more streamlined. So I feel in that moment, actually, this is helping me right. Instead of when I move and I have to like, I forget even two or three, the point points and then, bills end up in the old address and all of this, but If used in a right way, I think smart data can really add value to someone's life. And me personally, I think this is, this was very helpful to see how different countries actually, we manage this kind of information and how to make it in a most useful way. And I was positively surprised by, the flexibility and also like the Jada, how fluid this whole information flow was.</p><p>So I really liked. in terms of smart data, how you use this. Yes. It's in the wrong hands, every technology can be misused, but I think in the right hands, it can give a lot of value. And it's the same with any technology.

Hello, Fabian. You managed to do this last minute. Very good. yeah. Welcome everyone. we're going to do a smaller panel session ending at, 10 50. So we have around, just below half an hour, to get you a. To get doing this, which we're going to talk about getting ahead in eCommerce and it's going to be interactive.</p><p>everyone's invited everyone listening here invited to ask some questions in the chat. of course, these are some big companies than, with legal departments and PR department. So they might not be able to answer everything. but we'll, we'll definitely do our best to answer most of your questions.</p><p>Yeah, short introduction of the panelists you for her that is a talking to about it. So we won't take too long. We have brought from a journey, especially &nbsp;dot com. now all my rights, I think also on your rights, below me, we have Lucas false from optimizing online platforms at ATL needle on that's specifically a video launch.</p><p>They're a streaming service. And then the corner across from me is far beyond Kiersten digital. I'm a director of digital marketing skills and service at least plump. yeah. So let's start, with, the first question from my side, at least. And now I look at the stage, for the incoming, questions.</p><p>but let's start this, open it up. today's topic is about getting ahead in e-commerce. Which to me please sounds like knowing what's coming next. which is inherently difficult. Of course. but first question, that's the boss from, both gum, how is bold as golden forecasting and our hours that's, impacting how you handle customer behavior.</p><p>How are you forecasting, changing customer behavior? </p><p>Bas: [00:01:36] Hi. Good morning. Yes. Perfect. All right. I think, a large part of the focus of &nbsp;has to do with, with the way the teams are set up. So each, most divided the number of separate teams and each team is responsible for, a specific part of the product groups on Volcom.</p><p>we have more than 20 million products on our website, so we. We decided to categorize, those product groups into teams and these teams do most of their for custom for much part. so that gives us, yeah, I think a grand strategic advantage because those small teams are really, really going to blow up the product groups they're dealing with are able to forecast quite actually accurately because.</p><p>Guido: [00:02:19] What kind of data is going into that, is it external data or only internal data or combination or, </p><p>Bas: [00:02:25] yeah, I think both, we look at the market, of course, but also what did we do last year? how do we expect the market to develop? How do we expect both to develop, what the product, will be, will be edits to the collection or maybe, </p><p>Lucas: [00:02:38] Maybe even, </p><p>Bas: [00:02:39] to lead is one of the collection.</p><p>It's a combination of both. </p><p>Guido: [00:02:43] Yeah. In your section currently as a bicycle, camping and outdoor, I can imagine there are, there have been some changes last couple of months in those sections. what are the things that you've implemented changes that you've implemented based on those changes? </p><p>Bas: [00:02:57] I've only recently joined the new team, Or the 1st of July. before this, I was in the, the sports section, and some of the changes we noticed there were for a large part of the court to chose you to Corona. when actually waited at the state home for grownups, basically everything changed. So in the sports section, what we saw.</p><p>we had the old Lisa exercise at home materials, and they just went nuts. For example, we sold a third of times, the amount of dumbbells in one week that we saw in gear for, in the same week, basically the same goes for a prolapsed range and those were obvious stages. but we also have some change tree we saw coming less.</p><p>I think. So for chapel, we sold the 92 times the amount of badminton the next, in one week, then we saw the same week last year. and.</p><p>Guido: [00:03:54] Sorry, everyone already has a table or Bradley. </p><p>Bas: [00:03:57] Yeah. Yeah. badminton. but yeah, everybody has a field or at least the backyard, people want it to have something. </p><p>Fabian: [00:04:05] Yeah. </p><p>Bas: [00:04:06] some of the judges, as a, as small shopping team, you have to, you have to really adapt to this because you're announced, nobody was really prepared for Corona, of course, but, yeah, we had a limited amount of stock.</p><p>So you have to look where you can get extra stock. you have to look at pricing, you have to look at it. but just it's obviously, because she has those two months is a challenge in itself. So those were </p><p>Fabian: [00:04:30] all really </p><p>Guido: [00:04:31] challenging. Yeah. And, so I can imagine that's a &nbsp;some categories with apps I'm currently, or as you went down there, it's a mixed bag.</p><p>and that's, I think something you need to shift gears with different categories or get your focus, I don't necessarily have data about the automotive industry, or these incarcerate specifically, but I can imagine that's a, that's an industry that's been there hits much harder, in a negative way, unfortunately.</p><p>and so if I'd be on, have you and your team are able to make, quick decisions home, how have you done this and how have you adapted to this new situation and, in general, do you have any tips on teams to be more agile? Okay, </p><p>Bas: [00:05:11] thank you. Thank you very </p><p>Fabian: [00:05:11] much for the question. I think it's a very loaded question.</p><p>Lots of different aspects to look at indeed. And also of course, to the bit of background, I'm busy managing a central digital team, which looks at the 30 plus countries. So that means we also have to have a very, a global view on what was happening, especially with the covert situation. And one of the things that we were focusing on predominantly, whereas to look at the search intent that we saw on either on Google or also on the social channels to really follow a little bit of trends in terms of how people are actually looking for, leasing solutions or mobility solutions in general.</p><p>And as you can imagine, people being locked down, it was of course, quite an interesting development that we also saw then with the search. Insights that we received. So we had to really realize that also we look at the curve from the stock market over the last couple of months, we saw some similar behavior also when you looked at the search intense.</p><p>And so we kept a very close eye on that. And actually in the last couple of weeks, we actually saw that we surpassed actually search intent. From previous years, quite rapidly. So it was an incredible fast recovery. Let us to push also the organization to really move from a, let's say almost standstill situation and seeing that we didn't know exactly what to expect to try and to accelerate growth again.</p><p>And that's of course, quite a shift within a couple of months time. And that also meant, of course, that we had from a team perspective. And to look at things that we need to ramp up really fast again, while we've had actually more or less divested in the last couple of weeks before.</p><p>So what was, get back to acceleration mode. And it was a, that was quite heavy because, also as, the unemployment numbers are arising and a lot of areas, there's a lot of uncertainty, but at the same time, you see also we sold so that the competition wasn't sleeping. So some competitors of ours, they just kept on go.</p><p>And if there was no covert. So we also had to realize that there is a combination of things that need to be done. So first of all, of course, performance is one of my key focus areas. so that means really looking at, degeneration. For example, we looking on the online, how do you convert as quickly as possible, but at the same time, we also need to realize that when this is a huge aspect as well, right?</p><p>So there's a lot of. Of course, the anxiety of people traveling these days, that also meant that probably more people are not interested in a personal mobility solution. So we saw already quite a rise in mobility searches in the beginning of the year before covert. but now I think it becomes even more interesting.</p><p>So there's a tremendous amount of education that needs to be done. So we really have to look at. A combination of, let's say raising, basically the awareness parts, educating the market further, and really giving them insight on what leasing is all about and making sure that they really understand it.</p><p>and then secondly, of course, making sure we can put the right office in place. And that also meant that we are looking more and more into capabilities to optimize our medias. Bent as well, meaning that we need to look at, how can we target better? How can we build more insights also? How do we use, potentially social more as an eCommerce channel as well, instead of just our platform, really trying to engage customers and let's say prospects where we can, I find them.</p><p>And especially in the small, medium enterprise and privately sector, there's of course tremendous. Opportunities there. Whereas we originally are coming more from a corporate sector. but especially in the SME and the private sector, we expect a significant growth in the coming. Months. So team wise, I haven't really changed to that.</p><p>To be honest, it's more about acceleration actually in my domain where we say, okay, we need to go faster and building better insights. And we need to make sure that we can use data more efficiently going forward. And of course we've seen quite a lot of differences in countries, right? So at the Southern countries versus the Nordic countries, Also total different behaviors and that's sorts of dancing.</p><p>We need to embrace while following basically global templates. Do you answer the question, but please ask them if you, if I need to clarify some things, </p><p>Guido: [00:09:37] you feel like the business, we'll be back to a pre Covitz numbers before the end of the, </p><p>Fabian: [00:09:43] most likely not. Most likely not because I think the, yeah, it really depends.</p><p>So we don't know if there's going to be a second wave. we don't know how let's say some of the economics going to turn out and we probably also expect that quite a few companies will still find some impact over the course of the year. So we will need to see it. It's hard to answer with yes or no.</p><p>Guido: [00:10:03] Do you feel better prepared for us? If we would get a big second wave? Yeah, I </p><p>Fabian: [00:10:08] think we did get some notes, things out of it. And so things that we might want to do differently next time, definitely keep the pedal to the metal. So that's one thing that we probably need to continue doing because, what we're looking at changing customer and consumer behavior, we saw of course, a tremendous shift towards online purchase behavior, right?</p><p>So you look at all the big groups. Last in the eCommerce industry, especially, they're all growing like crazy. So of course, for us, the really good indicator that we just need to do better, what we do online. And of course, Omni channel is a big topic also for us. And so that also means we need to really combine often online, a lot more, going forward.</p><p>Guido: [00:10:49] Okay. so yeah, we had the mixed bag at the, at Boulder, depending on the category, but at least plan going down and now we have video launch. I think the streaming services in general, it had a big boom when everyone was certainly at home doing nothing. I haven't been having much more time, at their hands.</p><p>but for video streaming, you don't suddenly. Can create a more serious or more movies or more content, like that, I think. so Lucas, please, with those restrictions, how have you been, how have you been able to, how is video they'll be able to benefit from the situation? Oh, </p><p>Lucas: [00:11:23] that's it.</p><p>Everyone can hear me. Yes. Okay, great. I think we can split that up in two sections. The first section is, directly, hitting us, like in, for Netherlands was a whole March when the government decided to just basically have a smart lock down, like we called it. And then, number search we have, everywhere.</p><p>Yeah, sitting at home, so they want to do something. And then they look at streaming services and, in that period, we had also our main title, which was already planned, but we, just, made it a little bit earlier, like one week more called mafia. So that was just another, a shell riser, all the growth that we have seen over the past couple of months and its growth that we, yeah.</p><p>it's a really big. And, but now we having a little bit of a backlash of it, because, you can imagine, all content productions, needs to be recorded and, there are sometimes some intimate scenes in it. And, yeah, that's a bit, a little bit difficult when you have a one and a half meter it's just time.</p><p>because yeah, those can be done. yeah. The whole concert production industry is also really effective because it can do the work in a way that it used to. So they have to adapt as well, but yeah, sometimes just script already written. And how do you do that? yeah, you can imagine for all kind of content production or Intel deficient, both crossings scenes.</p><p>we have another challenge how to, yeah. after that, content planning a little bit of what we do, but that's, initial planning, Yeah, it's thrown out of the window, but we had already, we have benefited quite a lot. and we were really happy with it and almost argued, software developers has, to run overtime because of, yeah.</p><p>such a performance demands from our service because we have a very data intensive, surface. yeah, it's quite, yeah, it's quite a lot. You need to adapt on that as well. </p><p>Guido: [00:13:19] So maybe have you been able to, I'm not sure if that's even a thing for you guys, but I've been able to add external content.</p><p>You should just buy more content for people to watch. Sure. </p><p>Lucas: [00:13:28] I know our content team is really watching, introduce those opportunities. but yet again, you, then you have also quite some competition because. most of the dose, Colton things are a little bit of extra exclusivity.</p><p>So if Netflix buys it's from the Netherlands, then, we leave, we are empty handed. and, yeah, it's constantly with the getaway rounds and, yeah, it's it. Therefore also the competition on, already available content is also pretty high, so yeah, that's really something you need to look into as well.</p><p>I, but we has had some release dates already, which, we had to push down into the, into ultim. yeah, I thought also we really would have to have, right now, </p><p>Guido: [00:14:09] Yeah. Cool. And, you also released a new package. I'm going to ask you about that one. after I go through a, to a question from the chat and for everyone listening, please keep adding those questions.</p><p>I think, both, Fabio and Lucas already. Yeah. Answer the question from Chad, let me know Chet, if that's the case or if you have any additional questions, but I have a question for, for boss. yeah, it makes sense. So how do you deal with products which fit in more categories? Like you just told us?</p><p>So there are teams that bolt come split between different categories. but yeah, I think it's easy to imagine that you have certain products that fit in multiple categories and, might across different teams. So how does that work? </p><p>Bas: [00:14:48] Yeah, for example, I mentioned having, insured from, from idealists, it's what in the streets and stuff most, some sports items they're basically designed for sports are also word, especially in clothing.</p><p>yeah, obviously we're continuously asking yourself the question, where should this product be placed in the website? and I think of both, we split this into two different questions. So the first one is where do our customers look for these products? and most of the time of product, customers look for a product in different parts of the website.</p><p>So we make sure to, to locate those products, all parts of the website. So they can it this year, for example, we would disclose the shirt on the sports section, but also disclose it on the fashion section, depending of course, on the Accenture. so that's one side of the story. So just really ask yourself what do our customers want and where parachute, where should they be able to find it?</p><p>And that's really, that's really nice question to ask because it better, disclosed the products. so often without just disclosing that I've really, small parts your site, the other year, </p><p>Guido: [00:15:56] And our teams are teams that are multiple teams responsible for a single product. Does that happen or, </p><p>Bas: [00:16:04] yeah.</p><p>That's the other part of your question? So of course, we are, have to look at which team is eventually responsible for this product. and to this, we just basically set up some rules and make deals with theme store. For example, we would say that, </p><p>all shirts that are, codes that are, for example, other coats, are, are not part of the fishing fee, but are the responsibility, the outdoor team.</p><p>So a customer could find that in both locations, which is to create on effect that. In this specific case, the</p><p>so just, yeah, we evaluated this every year, actually saw if after a while the fashion team says, Hey, that code is actually more professional that maybe after a year they will go to fashion for a customer. There won't be much change.</p><p>‍</p>",,48a3ebea

Our podcast partner Convert.com and CXL teamed up to get the CRO industry report of 2020 updated again. How are we as a CRO industry are moving forward and in what aspects. Join this annual survey so we can all shortly enjoy the results: <a href=""https://cxl.com/blog/2019-conversion-optimization-report/"" target=""_blank"">https://cxl.com/blog/2019-conversion-optimization-report/</a></p><p>‍</p>",YnFujp5OKgc,,,"<p>Today we're going to talk about the different options that you have if you want to work in conversion optimization. Roughly speaking there are three main paths that you can take. I've taken all three of them, so I want to share a little bit of my experience and a little bit about what you can expect.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Option 1: digital agency / marketing studio</strong></p><ul><li>Work within a team.</li><li>Give services to clients of the agency</li><li>Work on optimizing a website, webshop, landing pages or whatever that specific client needs.</li></ul><p>Pro:</p><ul><li>Work with other digital people with similar knowledge levels</li><li>Work with a diversity of clients and projects</li><li>Lot’s of fun<br></li></ul><p>That has actually been the <strong>first work</strong> that I had coming from the university. I was working for an ecommerce agency here in The Netherlands and was really, really a pleasure and especially when it’s a smaller agency you might also gain some <strong>general business experience</strong> in things like sales, account management and project management.<br></p><p>Agencies usually have a lot of <strong>specific domain knowledge</strong> within the company so it’s easy for them to<strong> train new junior</strong> people. So often what I see happening is that instead of raising salaries for seniors to keep knowledge in-house, they just hire a bunch of juniors instead to get the work done. So you don’t typically see the highest salaries at agencies.<br></p><p>Now in terms of how much you might actually earn, as with all the 3 main paths this obviously depends on where you are in the world and your experience level. I will link in the shownotes&nbsp; to a CRO survey that shows you some salary indications which you can check out.</p><ul><li>In general: average salaries for a beginning CRO specialist will be around 35-40 thousand dollars per year</li><li>quickly go up to 50 or 60K a year and if you’re really senior you can go up to 100K, especially if you work in the US, UK or Germany, other countries are typically lower.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>So that's roughly the range of what you might earn at an agency as a CRO specialist. Of course, if you're working in a big agency and you're getting into kind of management or director levels, or you even own part of the agency it might be higher, but this is more or less what you can expect when working for agencies solely in a CRO specialist role..&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Option 2</strong></p><p>Now, the second option that you have is actually working in-house in a company. Which can basically be anything, but since CRO mostly focuses on websites it’s usually gonna be a company, usually selling something to consumers and with a website that has a decent amount of traffic.<br></p><p>If you’re the first CRO specialist you might have a lot of freedom to do things the way you want you will probably join a team with people that are responsible for different parts of the funnel like SEO, SEA, Content creation, Branding, Customer support, Product development etc.</p><p>Since you might be the only one doing CRO or maybe just a hand-full of people that get what CRO even is, this might involve a lot of stakeholder management which means you need to keep a lot of people informed about what your do and keep them positive about experimentation and validation so you can keep the freedom and budgets you need for the execution of your CRO plan.<br></p><p>Actually this was my 3rd job experience after working at 2 agencies where I joined an inhouse team of digital marketeers where I was one of the 2 in-house CRO specialists. For me working in-house feels like you can go deeper into issues to really solve them because you're not charging by the hour (which you usually are when you’re working at an agency). You are most likely the owner of the projects that you execute on so you can see things through from conception to launch and for me those projects often make me feel more proud that the projects you do for clients when you work for an agency because you’re always gonna stay somewhat of an outsider.&nbsp;</p><p>In-house you can also have more focus because you’re constantly working on a single product or a single website so you get to learn all the ins and outs.<br></p><p>Depending on what you think is fun of course this can also be a downside because it’s gonna be one big project for a long time instead of smaller short term projects. If you’re really creative and get bored easily, in-house might not be your thing, and on the other hand while at an agency you probably have multiple client projects and you might need to switch to a different client each day or maybe even every hour so it really depends on you personally where your preferences lie.<br></p><p>As for the salaries you can expect to start a bit higher, maybe between 40 and 50K, simply because in-house teams don’t want the really junior people that they need to train, they want people that can execute right away and it’s not completely unusual to go over 120K for senior people although that usually again includes taking on some more team management tasks in addition to your CRO work or even more broader jobs like managing the whole e-commerce website if it’s a smaller online team.<br></p><p>The business you’re in and specifically the margins they make on their products and services and how scalable the business is can have a big impact on the range of salaries that you can expect. And in addition there might be collective labour agreements or unions that apply to that business that can also have an impact. Usually if it’s a completely only business they’re often quite scalable and you as a CRO specialist can have a huge impact so you can expect the highest salaries there. On the other hand there are also many more traditionally offline businesses that might have a small online presence that functions more like lead generation and typically those are more conservative when it comes to salaries. But again those are just averages and a lot of exceptions definitely exist.<br></p><p><strong>Option 3</strong></p><p>Now the third option, which is also what I’m doing right now is going freelance. And when you're going freelance, basically you are the master of your own destiny. You don’t have a boss and to a degree you can choose the companies you want to work with and do the work that you like best. If you imagine a Venn diagram where one circle represents the work that clients will pay you for and another circle that represents the work that you really enjoy doing: where those overlap, that is the sweet spot where you as a freelancer can be.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In terms of salary limitation because you don't need to ask for permission from anybody.</p><p>Because this is now your own business, nobody guarantees a sale for you. That being said, there's also no cap on how much money you can earn.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re able to do full time freelancing you might be making around 1500 billable hours a year and at an average rate of for example 150 dollars this would make you 225 thousand dollars a year in revenue from the freelance allone. And of course you can play around with your hourly rate and the number of billable hours you can make in a year to see that number go up or down.</p><p>Now of course this is revenue, not profit so you will have taxes and all kinds of expenses like travel, a car, office furniture, insurances etc etc that you now have to fully pay for yourself. And in addition to that you now also have the sole responsibility to do sales and marketing and finance and all the other aspects that come when running a business. So of course the idea here is that because you are taking a higher risk and you're doing way more than just CRO, you're also being rewarded with a higher income than when working in-house or at an agency, but definitely in your first years that might not necessarily be the case.<br></p><p>Looking at these three options, you see that each of these options have their pros and cons so which one is right for you? Well as always it depends, and it’s not just one thing right. It depends on where you are in your career, the kind of learning opportunities you’re looking for, the kinds of freedom you want and the amount of risk you’re willing to take. And these factors will probably not be static and these will change over time, many people in the CRO.CAFE community that I know have switched between these options at least once.<br></p><p>So basically if you only want to focus on CRO and don’t want to spend&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you only want to learn a lot in a short amount of time and improve your skill, then maybe working within a team where you have a manager with way more experience than you can be a great option.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to maximize your freedom and earning and you’re interested in running your own business, then maybe freelance is the thing for you.</p><p>And I think that, you know, a lot of times it's really hard to say because it can really depend on your personality what works best for you and again it can highly depend on the actual company and team that you’re working in how that experience works outs for you. And you might not know this up-front and you may need to experiment a bit with this. Especially when you’re working at an agency or in-house you could start a freelance business on the side - provided that your contract allows you to - and see if that is something that you like and maybe scale back your full time job to 4 or 3 days a week and combine it that way.<br></p><p>So I hope that this kinda gave you an understanding of what to look for. If you’re currently looking for a job in CRO and not sure how to approach this, just send me a message on Twitter or LinkedIn and I’m happy to give you some advice for your particular situation. Also in the CRO.CAFE podcast there are many interviews I did with people that work in any of these 3 situations and I’ve listed a couple of them in the notes below so you can listen to those and get a feeling of the work they do and the freedoms they have. And whether you’re completely new to CRO or already a veteran we’ll have much more interesting videos coming up so make sure that you’re subscribed for more amazing videos on CRO. See you soon and always be optimizing.</p>",,

Why should we do it? When should you do it? And that's what we're going to discuss. we have grant and we have kneels since we're on a first name basis now. You all know, guy off the risk presentation?</p><p>I think so, </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:00:20] unfortunately for everyone. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:00:21] Yep. no introduction needed. but Neal's, co owner and a data consultant that the data story, anything you want to add to that small introduction? What did you do with the personalization? </p><p>Niels Reijmer: [00:00:33] yeah, so my background, before this, before I became an independent consultant, I worked at the bank for five years for Americans and it's basically Nordstrom.</p><p>and there I worked on personalization and building it up from the ground up. So from nothing, building yourself and start doing it and learn it along the way. And after five years of fuck, nah, I can do this also as a company for myself to hit her with that. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:01] Exactly. And any specific tools you're using for personalization?</p><p>Niels Reijmer: [00:01:05] Preferably not. So it depends a bit on the client. tobacco-free built a lot of things ourselves, so we use for tracking, we use snowplow and then when crazy and any cloud platform, because we have the advantage to have engineers on hand as well. So I could say to them, you know what, I want to test this and I have this model and I want to implement it and make it scalable.</p><p>And they fro stuff. Technological stuff at me. And I was like, yeah, sure. As long as it works and scales, I'm happy. and now it's clients, it depends, it could be any tool. So some use home, build stuff, some use, the bigger, our data platforms. Yeah. He usual. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:41] Okay. And, at the first question, we already had the one in the APA during your talk.</p><p>So maybe you want to comment on that. isn't AI, just machine learning. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:01:51] It's a great question. Can we see people using the terms interchangeably all the time? Asking a bunch of data scientists, they would often say, look, AI is the umbrella, artificial intelligence machines, doing things that seem intelligent within it.</p><p>You've got rules-based, which is what most of us typically do when we start personalization and then machine learning where the machine is learning stuff on his own. There are other branches of AI. But tactically machine learning is a subset of AI as the big umbrella. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:18] I think I've also seen a couple of fund meme saying that, if you want to sell it's AI.</p><p>If, if you want to sell it to companies or marketing people, and if you want to hire people, if you want to hire the smart people that were one of the work with us, you call the machine. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:02:30] That resonates </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:30] a lot. Actually. That's basically the main difference. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:02:33] And if you're raising money, either one works.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:35] Yeah. Yeah. already had a question, another one for this session, from, I know that because he's too scared to answer, to ask it himself. And he's also not here. You ran away. but the question is, I think it's a very, common one, so most companies use personalization, at specific places on their own that way.</p><p>Sorry. It's but. the algorithms can, make sure that, the, the right contents, shown to the right person. but it doesn't really scale. you have many places on your websites that you can show different kinds of topic, but you need to generate that topic, the content for that.</p><p>and that's still something people need to do right now, at least. so how do you do this? how do you scale personalization in that sense? Once again, </p><p>Niels Reijmer: [00:03:20] in my experience, it's a transition, a company goes through. So the moment you start with personalization, for example, you have one content team creating content for one email, and that's being sent out the moment you start doing personalization.</p><p>Also, as guy told in his, presentation, you start rule-based. So you basically started with some segments and you send under set of one newsletter. You send a four. And often the content team can work with that and be a little bit more scalable, but there comes a point where everything breaks basically where you have 25 segments, you have machine learning, running, and everything needs to get together.</p><p>That's the moment when basically the organization for some part needs to be slightly or depending on how the organization is restructured content needs to be created on a different way. So in my experience, what. we have done in the past is, break content. So you have an image, you have text, you have different options, it's different buttons and you let them create that and let the algorithm, let it come to get.</p><p>Are there. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:04:16] I have a very similar reaction that as you're looking to scale, you should personalize throughout the entire experience. We find customers typically start with landing pages or homepage or checkout page, and then they personalize the whole thing. They might do something more, end to end, like I'm going to change the nav for everyone site-wide but then when they really want to scale, we find them doing two things.</p><p>One is just what Neil said, modularizing things. trying different combinations of things. Machine learning is pretty helpful there, cause it can automatically try all the combinations. The other way, one is to do more than what was premise of the question. Premise of the question was creating content.</p><p>You can personalize a whole lot more than the content itself. You can personalize the tone, the organization of things, what you show, how simple things are, what you hide. We have customers who without creating any new content, we'll pull things from other pages, like simple example, your B2B you're selling to businesses.</p><p>Somebody shows up, goes to a particular industry page. Great. Next time they show up on your homepage. Show that industry case study on your homepage, show logos from that industry on the homepage, greet them that way, all content you already have, but now it's more personalized meeting your prospect, where they are in their funnel with you.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:24] How fast should you do personalization? as a, as an example, I did a user study, where customers, they went through the category, a page shoulder, there are products they, they already filtered on or whatever. went to the product page. There's not a product I liked went back. everything was different because it was personalized.</p><p>it really, it didn't work for them. how fast should that. B, how fast should you work that into the customer experience? </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:05:50] In my humble opinion, that's it? That's a test. So you will have hypothesis, is somebody going to this category of products? They went to the soda page. Is them going there once enough of a signal?</p><p>Is this a product where that signal matters? if I'm going to, car forest site and I go to the soda page, does that mean, I only want to see soda? Of course not, but if I go to a car, if I go to. Oh, hell no. Rinaldo's page. And I go to a sedan. Should I see a sedan the next time I show up maybe not considered purchase it's worth doing.</p><p>And so in my humble opinion, there is no universal truth. there is so much of this it's worth trying out. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:24] Yeah. are burned, remaking. It much harder for ourselves. If we, create this, these never ending smaller and smaller groups that we can test them. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:06:34] In particular if you're doing it with rules.</p><p>Yeah. But it doesn't scale. That's why I think we typically top out at a few tens of rules. Yeah. If on the other hand you say, look, I'm going to constrain the things that I know about. Like the example earlier, right? you're an answer to him. You see the Netherlands promotion. Okay. You know that there are a handful of things like that, or, I say, Oh, they're interested in the sedan fund.</p><p>I'm gonna show the sedan stuff, but the rest I'm gonna leave it unconstrained. I'm gonna let a system go try all the possible combinations. So I actually make fewer choices, not more choices then I think it can scale nicely. Yeah. Does that resonate? </p><p>Niels Reijmer: [00:07:10] Yeah, totally. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:07:11] Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:13] Done audience questions on personalization.</p><p>Go ahead. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:07:17] yeah, I've got one question. Do you think that, you should always try to get as personal as possible or do people experience some sort of uncanny Valley feeling at a certain level? Do you have any experience with </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:28] where's the limits? </p><p>Niels Reijmer: [00:07:29] Yeah. there's certainly a limit, and I've hated a couple of times.</p><p>So we did a test where we predicted, based on. Not the information, but the shoe size of a client and not based on the shoe size, they filtered, but on other sizes they bought. So suddenly we showed a shoe size and what's pre-filled and then you get, I think also in an interesting topic where recommenders reach UX, which is closely related, and we had the possibility to go to a store and ask customers, like, how do you experience this?</p><p>And we had a couple of different ways to deal with this because you can. make it scary by how you present it. So ID, you can explain it. So for example, we had an option where we said to a client or to a customer, we predicted your shoe size based on the other sizes of clothing you bought.</p><p>Let's say, yeah. Now I understand fine with it. another option is not to show that we know your shoe size, but just change the sorting of the products and you will never know. So we change your experience without you. Are you seeing it or knowing it that we. Got this data from you. So there's yeah.</p><p>Playing field there, but it's certainly a appointed. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:08:36] I agree completely and would add two additional things. I think the line for what feels creepy continues to move, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, you go to a large company's website and you say, you're going to run multiple versions of your site.</p><p>They would say, it's going to look broken. There's no way you should do this. But now we all experience Amazon and Netflix and other places. We're used to it. We expect it even in our business environments. what was creepy before may not be now. I think right now it's in like a B2B environment saying what company you're from, because you did reverse IP lookup is like on the border saying, Oh, I know your name is whatever your, your name that for most people really is creepy unless you came from an email that was already addressed.</p><p>So that's not one thought too, you can ask permission. We have some customers that say, look, I want on a personalized and I want to do it in an extreme way. I'm going to ask them either to say, Hey, personalize this experience for me, literally as a button, they press on the page or ask them for segments.</p><p>We have some customers that like serve very different segments, like a marketplace. They have buyers and sellers and you can say, look, am I buyer? Am I a seller? And then the whole experience will change made a choice themselves, which is similar to the explanation. There's a rationale for it. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:44] How would you figure out the creepiness of a page?</p><p>Because I can imagine that, personalization that works, within the session for a user, but it also creeps them out in a way that they might not return that they don't somehow it didn't like the feeling of this that didn't have the great experience that they were looking for. they bought something because they needed it today for whatever reason, but they won't be returning for this.</p><p>So how do you balance that? </p><p>Niels Reijmer: [00:10:12] How do you measure it? Or how do you balance it? how do you measure it is with basically all the tools you do AB testing with in that sense, doing personalization, in my opinion, is nothing, this similar, none doing irregular AB test, you ask your customer, you do your research beforehand, afterwards.</p><p>you look at the metrics returning clients, you look at customer lifetime value. Yeah. You take those things into it. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:10:33] I agree completely. It's qualitative and quantitative, same metrics. And then I think you said it like. Just ask literally, because there is that subjective individual creepiness factor that's worth talking to some people about.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:45] Yup. Good. One next, go ahead. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:10:50] And Nigeria, I once plant in your head. So philosophy. Cool. Thoughts about personalization? </p><p>Big discussions in Brussels been going on for a while. about this idea that personalization it's basically about individualization me as an individual. And there's a very specific sector that you're impacted by this heavily, which is insurance.</p><p>The reason why is because how is risk distributed within insurance? It's the fact that we're all together and for that person that has a problem now. basically all that money goes to that. Person one way or another. And so where would our societies go? And I'm not asking the question. I'm just planting that in your heads.</p><p>As a seed to say there might be </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:37] businesses </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:11:38] where pulling together as a group die. Dear underwear individualization might not be a good idea. So how far will insurance companies go in terms of personalization is probably one thing to see and watch out for that might be like a barrier to evolution. If, and if you have any thoughts </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:00] of scripts, you're welcome.</p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:12:04] I do think none on that specifically, but in similar things have heard people say, Hey, should this be considered, can this be. contextual variable in personalization. Okay. Technically, scientifically. Yeah, of course it can do we, as a society, want it to be, I think those are two separate choices.</p><p>You have the tool and then you have, what do you want to allow it to do? </p><p>Niels Reijmer: [00:12:27] I was thinking to me, it sounds a bit similar to a question in the previous podcast I was asked about if your client says do it and someone else's do it, will you do it? And there's also. If in a company that is something that needs to be decided, and if it's possible, a company will do it and it doesn't matter, make it right.</p><p>But at the same time, there are multiple laws in place for areas like this for insurance. I'm not sure. I'm not in that area of expertise. but yeah, I can imagine that there are, you always get bounced there, and high risks in that sense where it destroys basically the product insurance. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:13:07] And in other cases, trust, we had a customer ask us to do something that the motivation wasn't bad, but as we looked at it, we're like, this is deceptive.</p><p>And they said, I understand, but I'd like you to do it. And we said, no, we respectfully decline. We want do this for you. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:21] We can test that, but me, we shouldn't be implementing it. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:13:26] No, we said, we want to test it. We want </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:29] the next question. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:13:30] How do you solve the. That's you can call it the Netflix bubble.</p><p>when a customer has a, some experience on a website, it's personalized, the comebacks comes back for two weeks, but after a year it's maybe a totally different person. Maybe he or she is married or as kits or something, So the bubble changes from the person's life, but does he enter the same bubble or.</p><p>You know what I mean? Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:58] Or do you read, or do you reset or yeah. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:14:00] Yeah. So we've seen several techniques. One is just that resetting from time to time, starting from scratch and learning a new, another one is to have a bunch of rules around behaviors that trigger effectively a reset or move to a different segment.</p><p>You could imagine equivalent, let's say in a B to B environment, right? Somebody exhibited behaviors. Okay. I've never been here before. Great. They're a fresh prospect. I've been here four or five times. Maybe they're mid funnel. I submitted a demo request. All right there later. Later funnel, same logical thing, right?</p><p>They're at a different bubble based on their actions. Third is to try, with machine learning, to have something that's continuously updating itself. So it's constantly taking into account new behavior and it probably has some notion of waiting, or it could have a notion of waiting of more recent behavior is more important than long time ago, behavior so that when he or she exhibits that new behavior a year from now, you said maybe they have kids.</p><p>You can see, okay, now they're buying diapers and a year ago they were buying beer </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:56] and you can look at action, but you can also look to inaction. That also is a factor in machine learning. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:15:01] said. </p><p>Niels Reijmer: [00:15:03] Yeah. Yeah man. Maybe one small addition. If you're looking really from an, from a recommended perspective, what you're trying to do is normally if you look at a product recommendation specifically, you're trying to recommend products that fit the user really well.</p><p>So one of the strategies that often is applied is then to do a diversification around it. So you have 20 products that really closely matched the preface of the user, but you don't recommend those 20 year recommend five out of those. And then in the circle around it, which is close, but less, you pick two in the circle around that you pick two and then you get a diversification and then you get the option of the customer showing behavior outside of its bubble.</p><p>So they have their bubble, but you show information outside of it. And then applying techniques like. Taking that behavior into account in your algorithm, you can make sure they can escape their bubble. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:15:49] Oh, maybe that answers my second question, because when I'm in the Netflix bubble for say a month, and I saw oldie Marvel films, for a, for example, I want to see something else, but keeps posting me to same, movies, and I think like tired of it.</p><p>So I throw it at the Apple way or something or wanting to do something else or. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:11] So </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:16:11] that's a tricky one. I think so. Okay. Building on what Neil said, you can do that. And, something underlying, what you said is you can make a classically, there are four ways to go. Four classes of algorithms to go make recommendations like that, either on product or on content.</p><p>And the distinction that I think is particularly useful here is are you basing it on how items are similar? okay. You watched one Marvel movie. Now you watch another Marvel movie or are you basing it on user behavior? Similarity. People who liked things that you like and therefore similar to you, they'd like these other things too.</p><p>And that second one can then help you break out of that bubble of similar </p><p>content. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:48] And, also in that case, I think, from a company perspective, in this case, Netflix, it's probably not a big issue for them anyway, because it's a really, it's the exception probably. So their ultimate thing for the larger group.</p><p>And if it doesn't work for that 5%, that are all the exceptions, it doesn't really matter. As long as it's worked for that 95%, is making them a little money.</p><p>Any more questions? Yes, go ahead. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:17:16] I guess this is on the same vein, but. In an ecosystem where you're doing like machine learning, testing, and a lot of personalization wouldn't, an excessive amount of personalization, dilute the noise and like the variants and therefore your opportunities for discovering new insights it's of the testing aspect, because if you're through Excel, so personalization, if you're creating cohesive, then you're limiting yourself from.</p><p>Highly variant experiences where you might find </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:46] you inside, or maybe there's an algorithm pro promoting that. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:17:52] yes, I think there are a couple of parts of the answer. One is literally that you're balancing, exploring versus exploiting to the earlier discussion, right? If you're creating these highly cohesive experiences and just optimizing for those, because they work, then you're exploiting the knowledge you have and you've chosen to swing the balance away from.</p><p>Yeah. From time to time. I want some randomness. I want some diversity. Maybe I get something other than Marvel. Maybe I get a non cohesive part of the experience so that you can continue learning. he's one part. The other part is if you're using a system that has a bunch of contextual data fed into it, you can then slice the data and learn.</p><p>Maybe the machine is doing it already, but you can yourself as part of the analytics after the fact. Glean insights that maybe weren't that obvious before, right? Okay. You have this homogeneous experience for this group, but when I slice it by mobile or weekdays or people who've been here twice before people who have been a customer more than three years, you learn something new and you're able to create a new experience out of the data that's already there, even though the thing is creating cohesive experiences.</p><p>Anything else? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:51] Yeah, I think it makes sense to always have some part of your group that you always randomize or test for, do some multi arm bended, but there's also always a group that's, doesn't get the treatment, but it's randomized and what they get and see how that works. Maybe that's something better.</p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:19:07] So we tend to use that anyway, so that we, as folks doing optimization can say, look. I made us a lot of money because cause otherwise you do before, after analysis with all the problems that come with it. So we always encourage a whole back group, even though it's not for that reason, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:22] but it helps. Yeah.</p><p>Yeah. Next question. Anyone.</p><p>let's see. Oh yeah, we do have a question. Yes. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:19:34] okay. What personal personalization. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:36] You have a lot of </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:19:37] options to fill the website. And how to </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:41] analyze </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:19:42] all those options.</p><p>Niels Reijmer: [00:19:47] That depends totally on them, which state you are by the way. so I think this guy was already setting this in his presentation. When you start with rule-based, it's fairly easy. you have one rule versus the other, so you test for that and. The moment you get more into machine learning, you are starting to think, at least I started to thinking, all right, this is just algorithm version a, this is algorithm version B and version C and version D.</p><p>And now I'm doing a multivariate test where the content is done by algorithm content. A and the product recommendation is done by number B. And then I crossed that and then you move from there. It asks quite a lot from your tracking, I think because you need to track a lot of more stuff that's being shown to the user, but at the same time you're doing that already because that's, what's feeding your algorithm.</p><p>So to start doing algorithms, you need to measure a lot, like you want to know what did they see, what they click, how long, that sort of thing. And the moment you have that it's adding a version to it. So this is algorithm a and that's right. At least how I approached </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:20:50] that problem. Two additional thoughts to add, in trying to analyze the data, I would suggest to start with the strategy, what's the business goal you're trying to achieve.</p><p>Okay. Which user flow corresponds to changing that where the big drop offs are at, we're focusing our energy here then just did it produce the results you wanted? ultimately right? Because you can analyze the personalization in particular, if you have a lot of contextual data, Forever infinitely.</p><p>just see, did it ultimately produce the results one that's the biggest, I think that'll matter then when you're trying to gain additional insights, you can use analytics to slice and dice a million ways. You could also use it to just find things that are unexpected, things that over or under index, relative to what you expected.</p><p>So you can say, Oh, we tried these two things and for everyone, they were showing it performed like this. But for mobile, it was like up here or for, in Belgium, it was down here. and those outliers can be instructive if they're not tiny audience sizes. And tuning the way you're looking at it, rather than trying to boil the ocean for those outliers, when they're big enough can be also helpful.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:51] Are there any specific, personalization that when you have a new clients, they always say, okay, we should do this. these usually work, maybe in a specific vertical, but. What are the it's, you're both nodding very, </p><p>Niels Reijmer: [00:22:05] there are multiple tricks you can apply to her. a customer never comes in empty.</p><p>there's always, they're coming from another place they're coming in direct, via for is some device at a certain location in a certain geo. So there's a lot of information you already have that you can apply to some, in some sense through your website. So saying I always love the cold user problem.</p><p>They're called to a certain extent. You don't have a full profile, but they are never without information unless they say, yeah, I don't want to be virtualized ignore or cookies then. Yeah, sure. But then that's not my problem anymore. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:22:41] Okay. Yeah, sure. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:22:43] w I think part of why it's valuable to try a bunch of ideas is because there are no universal truths right there.</p><p>It's one thing that works in one environment may not work in another. and so it's why you want to be able to iterate rapidly that having been said, we do, from experience, as I bet, a bunch of us have points of view on, on an eCommerce cart page, here's some high probability place to run on a checkout page.</p><p>Here's some on a PDP page. Here are some, okay. That could be a long list. The one that we almost always talk about that we all know we should do, but we don't is to treat existing customers and prospects differently. We treat them the same. Often because we're just accountable for acquisition. So we don't care.</p><p>No, but if you take that existing customer and show them the latest thing you developed or give them cross seller, upsell, or ask them to recommend, so you can drive more acquisition, you typically have the content already. And could you, yes </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:32] and no, but I guess also many businesses, they don't know the customer.</p><p>If they're returning, not every customer logged in, so that might be an issue for </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:23:38] them. And you can then use the system to remember, have they ever logged in yep. And use that accordingly. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:45] If they're using the same browser or a </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:23:46] hundred percent just like totally. Yeah. Unless you're using a system that connects them, but that's a whole different privacy question unrelated.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:53] Oh yeah. We already had that. but, so there are certain things that, that's that word. What would you say is the most surprising things that you saw in, in terms of, the personalization things that's unexpectedly. Had a huge effect or the other way around you think, this should have had an effect that didn't do any, </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:24:11] so at least for me, the answer is like all the time.</p><p>There's not one, there's so many because. There aren't universal truths, right? It's not always true that red button works. It's not always true that, some huge changes what matters. And we've had things that like intuitively make total sense. You remember that somebody's been here before you show their competitor logos, you'd be environment didn't matter.</p><p>And then we have stuff that we thought would be wouldn't matter. And did we had a e-commerce customer that tried like recently viewed it items to drive up card size. They tried changing how the products were presented. Tried more calls to action, try bigger pricing, all this stuff. The biggest impact on that page in this particular one was emotionally affirmative language at the top of the cart.</p><p>This was selling women's jewelry. This looks great on you. Good choice. We like that in there. That environment in that moment, it made a difference. I could imagine in a B to B environment, wouldn't matter at all there it did. And so it's the. You asked for the exception. I feel like that's actually the rule that happens all the time, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:08] but that's the great thing about our job, right?</p><p>Niels Reijmer: [00:25:10] Yes. Maybe one, one example that I experienced where we created a, carousel with, products that were pretty similar basically to the one you were looking at or have been looking at. and the funny thing, the funny thing was the click through of the carousel was through the roof. It tripled.</p><p>It was immense. The only downside was in the end, people bought less. So basically what we've shown there is the classical problem of choice overload where we say, yeah, here you have a tee shirt. You've looked at this and here we have a bunch of other shirts that are really similar. Have a look. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:41] Yeah. We have time for one final audience question </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:25:45] I had too, but, I'll ask one.</p><p>one was that on the top of my tongue, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:49] you can ask the other, which </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:25:50] is a Dutch expression. ITP. Is that a problem? The tracking protocol, because Safari, as only stores the cookies for a week and I know two weeks a week, I </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:26:02] think now they went back to the 24 hours. Yeah, really? </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:26:08] But is that a problem for personalization?</p><p>How do you solve this? </p><p>Niels Reijmer: [00:26:14] It is a problem and it's a solvable problem. So move to service cookies. I know someone you can talk to now, at one point in time, there was a previous conversation who can help you with that? no, but there are multiple technological, yeah, developments there. So it is solvable.</p><p>and now it feels to me like an arms race that's going on, where there's now new technology, which, ignores ITP. And then there will be something coming up that will block that new technology again. So to me, it's solvable </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:26:45] problem and there's a lot of money to be made here, so it will be solved.</p><p>Niels Reijmer: [00:26:50] Yeah, exactly. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:26:52] Oh, he wants to comment on that one. </p><p>Guy Yalif: [00:26:56] I just had a last question. Do you think that's personalization and profiling is the same thing and should users </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:27:03] have a choice? There you go.</p><p>In the next podcast, you might have the answer. </p><p>Niels Reijmer: [00:27:17] I'm really thinking hard about this. I need a couple of born beers before afford this, I think, but I can have a shot. I think crystallization, it's going to be based on a profile and you can't do it without basically building a profile by doing it on why not looking at you as an individual, but looking broader.</p><p>It can be. Done. but I always think the customer has the full right to say, I know one personalization, I don't want profile. I want out. And then you do that. And then, like I said before, I literally say then they are not as someone responsible for personalization. They are no longer my problem, those customers, because I said, we'll give him the usual.</p><p>We'll give him the same user experience with filters and sorting, but it's not based on their behavior anymore. Yes. </p>",true,c3b41dd5

Maybe not as everyone wants to do. Talk about the, this, I think internally, I don't know. It depends on the company, but definitely an important one. So for this topic, first off we have ugly bulls data governance and privacy engineer, and we have, Dunkers.</p><p>Independent consultant in marketing analytics. And as we all already heard from, from Aria, I suggested Rick, what do you, have to say about this topic in general? why are you here? Why are you a panelist? </p><p>Rick Dronkers: [00:00:37] I guess why I'm a panelist is, I've been forced to, Handle this topic a lot in my profession.</p><p>Yeah. But, yeah, actually grew to like it, or at least, it grew an interest in why it's important and especially like how can we help clients make sense of, actually implementing all these things or making sure that what they are doing is actually somewhat compliant to what the law suggests you should be doing.</p><p>And also, how can you still get the best out of the tools we all love in our, in our industry. And that has helped have helped us a lot, but not all of them are, as privacy friendly as, we might want, so yeah. Or shoot him. Yeah, </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:01:19] perhaps. </p><p>audience A: [00:01:20] Yeah. and we had a couple of questions already in the app, so I think it would make sense to go through a couple of those first, during your sessions.</p><p>one of them is, so what will be more valuable? Is it setting rules for companies or should we actually be creating more awareness by the customers? Would that have a well, will be more valuable? What would have a larger </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:01:40] effect? It depends who, for who? It's more valuable. Are we talking about society in general or our industry?</p><p>For the greater grids. let's see. I think, parts of awareness have been done by certain supervisory authorities. because part of the GDPR is really reinforcing these rights of the data subjects. And so where I come from, they have really pushed, like crazy to say, please complain about your data processing operation.</p><p>So I have templates if you want in Spanish, for everything, which is. I'll tell you amazing. </p><p>audience A: [00:02:18] So incentivizing people to complain. </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:02:21] Yeah. Yeah. Use their rights to privacy and to ask questions to companies to say, I want to understand what you're doing with my data, which is one of the objectives of the GDPR.</p><p>So education of users of data subject is I think first society certainly very important. I talked to my sister a lot. She lives in Amsterdam. She has an Android phone. She uses apps. I would never tell, not anywhere that's okay. and we have conversations and she realized, Oh my God, Google is reading my emails.</p><p>And you're like, yeah, of course it's an OTT. And over the top service, it's not the telco and it has no confidentiality obligations whatsoever. So what else is new? My dear sister. And she was like, she doesn't know what I'm talking about. so clearly, yeah, education and for people to understand what the consequences are of how they use technology.</p><p>because it's a bit like I compare it to cereals boxes of cereals. I didn't know if you have children ghetto, but, </p><p>audience A: [00:03:22] but he's one year old, </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:03:23] so it's fine. Yeah. So yeah, it's that out, but if they watch advertising, I will bet you anything that one of your kids will come and say, I want Cheerios. I own this.</p><p>I want that. And as a mother, you're like, No, and you're not eating that drawer once a week, maybe, but this is not going to be your regular breakfast and the same should happen with data. do you want a Amazon ring in front of your doorbell? Yes. No, it's your choice, but if you don't understand what it means or what the consequences are about, Oh, it would be a good idea to start doing.</p><p>audience A: [00:04:01] And maybe you wanted to, with your neighbors. </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:04:05] Yeah. Yeah, maybe you do well, maybe there are different things we can deliver you </p><p>audience A: [00:04:09] guys. </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:04:10] yeah. Yeah. so yeah, education of, of the public, but also understanding by companies who want to use data for their growth, because data is the new oil or whatever you want to call it.</p><p>is also understanding the risk of fines, the risk of having their data flows, being cut by supervisor authorities, or certainly the risk of losing the trust of their customers. So recently I bought water bottles and Amazon because it's called in Sarah and Madrid, and I'm very happy to have emails from Amazon to tell me, buy new water bottles.</p><p>I have three. Thank you very much. I don't need more. And so this issue of advertising in digital. It's not new. This has been going on for 15 years now. Sarah just need to come through better. Are you kidding me? It should be better. </p><p>Rick Dronkers: [00:04:58] But I think it's also a little bit of a complacency of it has been easy to just implement decks and not maintain them and just accept the fact that you place this Facebook deck or Google tech and they take care of the rest.</p><p>And that's how it has been. And there's a big gap between marketers operating. Advertising technology. And the people implement that technology and people implement it. Don't care about it. They just got an assignment to implement that tech once 15 years ago or something, that's exaggerating, but that's what I see at companies.</p><p>And there's a big gap of. The people using the advertising technology or the CRO technology or whatever, and not understanding the technology, like what they are implementing, like the text they're implementing and what those texts are potentially also harvesting besides what they are using it for. </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:05:47] Yeah, it's still not easy because the vendors don't make it easy.</p><p>when you look at, I dunno, one of the product features, customer audiences by Facebook. So you look all this kind of selling stuff for technologists and how you implement it. Take a look at the terms and conditions and how it's written. They don't do UX on terms and conditions. That's care.</p><p>Rick Dronkers: [00:06:12] Even if they did people would still, most people would still not read them. So that's also a big problem. </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:06:17] It's difficult to find. So we're having like discussions increasingly, about what is the responsibility of digital analysts, CRO specialists and things like that. I think if you recommend a tool, you should at least know where the terms and conditions are.</p><p>Yeah, I think they should go together because it means that if you recommend a tool to a company, you say from a technology and analytic standpoint, it does this is how you implement it. And then for the privacy officer, the DPO or whatever you have the other bit, which is, and this is what it means from a legal stuff </p><p>audience A: [00:06:49] who here knows where to find all the privacy statements from the tools they use.</p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:06:56] Two hands really difficult to find, and they change all sites. It's something that you talked about, the dynamism of it and how things are evolving and changing. It's like you implemented your Q and a tested. You have a beta version or whatever, or you have a test versions, but then how do you make sure that's moving forward?</p><p>The trial has not changed. They don't, integrate pixels with one another. That was, yeah. </p><p>Rick Dronkers: [00:07:23] Even like the same pixel that you have implemented two years ago, it can contain new functionality today without you changing the code because they're loading a script from their end of the website, not from your end, so you're not in full control.</p><p>So that makes it really hard. </p><p>audience A: [00:07:37] Did we have any audience questions then? </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:07:42] It's okay. </p><p>audience A: [00:07:45] I'm a curious, You work at a tech company as well. That's sales, I think analytics kind of software. I work at one as well. And the experience is that the market is not asking for it yet. And yet there's a tech company you'd like to explain it.</p><p>And the opposite response usually is, but I lose 90% of what I used to have in our own experience. For example, to retargeting snippet. Now it's behind consent for us on Facebook. My marketing team lost basically 90% of that returning audience. </p><p>Rick Dronkers: [00:08:23] Yeah. </p><p>audience A: [00:08:24] We accepted it, but how difficult it is as a tool to balance the loss of potential revenue yet explaining a feature.</p><p>Privacy, which you hope eventually will be part of your core business, but yet not is not there yet. I think that balance is really difficult as a smaller company. It's easier to make those decisions out of like principle. and that we don't do this. We're focused on privacy. So I scraped as a larger company.</p><p>Yeah, nothing that you work for a company in U S, which is more a collect, more collect more, and now only the CCPA. </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:08:57] So hold on. So let's step, a bit back because there are different positions here and different challenges. First of all. So I'm a DPO, a data protection officer for CDP, a customer data platform, called mParticle out of New York, as a product.</p><p>We onboard first party data, and also anything you guys collect, so Google, whatever. And we allow our customers to link this to our partner data. So it's a Facebook, Google, or whatever who we work with. we act as a data processor in the sense that. We act on their behalf. We don't decide they used the data and it means we don't have these discussions about consent.</p><p>It's up to our customers to decide with the tools downstream that they use. They are going to ask for consent, whether they're going to use other lawful basis of, to them. But it's clear in our contracts. We say, it's your responsibility. Now, if you want us to help you with consent or things like that, we integrate it with IAB consent framework because I asked or not super partisans of it, but okay.</p><p>It's there. we integrated with one trust because it was part of it as well. And we have our own consent management. So it means that. When it comes to, for example, to consent, we support, but go out and in saying it's a product feature or things like that. We did choose to do something else. And it's called open GDPR.</p><p>It's a framework it's open source. You can find it on GitHub, which basically takes in data, subject requests from our customers in digital and passes it on through the pipelines, towards our partners. They reception that and work on it and they, we get it back and we serve that back to our customers. this is where we positioned ourselves.</p><p>We said we don't decide about consents. We don't decide the lawful for basis. We onboard first party data. So it means that personal data, or do you want to call it PII? If you prefer it's there. We did push for certain limits. We had conversations about this because I worked for DMPs before and was like, no PII.</p><p>I said, Oh, so we take personal data because we're a CDP. Where is the limit, what don't we want? And this is where it gets interesting because you're an American company. And so the lawyers in America write rules. And so the law is we don't want senses active data. Okay. So sensitive data under us law is social security numbers, financial data and health data.</p><p>It is not union membership, racial discrimination, religious preferences or things like that. It's not the same definition as the GDPR. So we have processes in place to say off of our platform, the sense of data us, and we trained our teams, our onboarding teams to say, this is sensitive data in G in the GDPR, in Europe.</p><p>Anything that touches from far or close on this, you escalate. So I have an open door policy. I get questions from yes, CSMs and things like that. And we make decisions based on what type of client it is, what the contracts say, how they've been red line. We sometimes send emails back to say, could you please confirm that this is what you want?</p><p>We escalated towards certain apps to say, We think you're not as compliant. Could you please make sure. And where they writes back by saying we are compliant. So I have that written. If somebody says that company is not doing what it should said, I know, but they told me they would and it's inside our contracts.</p><p>So from a technology perspective, it's a balance between. What kind of features do I develop? Do I decide to work on open GDPR? And this is where mParticle worse in 2016. And how do I hedge in terms of contracts? What's interesting now, for example, is open GDPR. Wasn't used by our European customers and is now being opened for CCPA because it's not very different.</p><p>It's just notion of sale and things like that. But we are using the GDPR as a baseline to upgrade with potential other legislations that are coming. So we're, we're very heavy on mobile. and so we get questions like, is there any privacy legislation in Africa? You bet your ass. There is privacy legislation.</p><p>I forgot there we'll have little details that we'll have to append onto the platform. And then it's a cost benefit discussion, but we realize that everything we built in 2016 now in 2019, makes total sense for CCPA. So I'd say it's betting on the future to see, okay. How far does it go? Obviously, if I asked for features that are extremely expensive, the CTO is going to smile and say, I love you very much already, but no.</p><p>audience A: [00:14:20] And also had another question. I think you might be able to answer it. if you're a CRO specialist working in a company and you've been deep diving in this a bit more, but. If my boss doesn't really care about privacy, if my clients don't really care, </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:14:37] why should I care? </p><p>Rick Dronkers: [00:14:39] Yeah. Besides </p><p>audience A: [00:14:40] incentivize to do this, </p><p>Rick Dronkers: [00:14:42] I think, besides you, besides your own like moral compass, like as long as you're good with what you're doing, you, yeah, you could do whatever and you can bypass all current technologies, ITP ad blockers.</p><p>Like for everything, there is a potential solution to track. Anyway. and then I think like she already mentioned, then it becomes a risk reward kind of thing. if, if you are comfortable with the risk you're taking of not complying with a law potentially, then for sure you can bypass ad blockers.</p><p>You can extend cookie lifetime best what ITP is doing. You can buy, I passed what Firefox is trying to do for sure. There are solutions to all of those. </p><p>audience A: [00:15:23] I think the question was partially. I think that's how I read it. okay. if no one, if my boss doesn't care, my client doesn't care.</p><p>Would I be personally responsible for this? Is this, </p><p>Rick Dronkers: [00:15:34] the lawyer don't play one on the internet. So I have no idea. if you, perhaps, if you, as a consultant do that, but probably the company is still at fault. Like the company who hires you to do it, they make the decision to do it. Yeah. But for future reference, if you do that and they get caught and.</p><p>they get to find because of you then maybe your future consulting services might get some damage from that. Yeah. </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:15:57] So it's interesting because it, it touches upon, criminal liability. Basically you as an individual, which is where we're not, we're talking yeah. About liability of a company and they could get finance, things like that.</p><p>The only person I hear about where there's a discussion around normal criminal liability is Alexander nix. And seriously, these discussions are not going away. so he might be a pretender to put potential legislation coming up. Yeah. Which, but it's not there and it won't be for the next year or yeah.</p><p>audience A: [00:16:30] Depends on your level of influence in the company and the decisions? </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:16:34] No, it's never, for the moment these fines are company related. They will not never be about an individual. So the </p><p>Rick Dronkers: [00:16:41] answer is you're safe. Go ahead. </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:16:44] Brand reputation as you highlighted brand reputation. </p><p>Rick Dronkers: [00:16:48] Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. I do think that's something to think about, right?</p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:16:51] if you </p><p>Rick Dronkers: [00:16:51] go full blackout, like in the SEO world, they're also. Black hat people are well. Yeah. They have a certain reputation. And if that's how you want to make your money, then that's up to you. But </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:17:02] yeah. Yeah. The interesting thing is also, I didn't know what your background is, but I'm not a lawyer now.</p><p>And it's, it means that we're less. I think we're less skitty about giving advice and putting ourselves out there. The lawyers are very much, and here's a disclaimer. I work with a lot of American lawyers, but you're like, come on guys, can we please move forward? And I do understand their liability, we need to have straightforward.</p><p>Rick Dronkers: [00:17:30] Yeah. I do think that's an important point that like, I hope a lot of companies who try to become like, Compliance. So a lot of things have to do with the cookie banner. And then the first question you ask me is, what, how should we configure it? And then I'm also hesitant to give like a definitive advice.</p><p>I'm like, okay, these are websites that are comparable to you that have it. Configured in this, how they configured it. Yep. But yeah, I'm not a lawyer. I'm not going to say you have to have the marketing thing on or out, or, think about it, decide for yourself. I can help you configure it and make it all work and actually make all your scripts.</p><p>Listen to the cookie banner, which most websites don't do. They just put up a cookie vendor and they just fire all cookies without you giving consent. But yet what the choice that you're going to make in that. And that's, I think in the end of companies should. Invest in that and make that decision.</p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:18:17] Yeah, it does. This is where my position has DPO facing the CML was pretty easy and was like, the conversation started very simple as I'm your DPO. I do not want any tracking tools, I suppose you want everything. So now let's have a conversation and find the middle ground in terms of risk. but I started there.</p><p>It's I want anything on the website. </p><p>audience A: [00:18:39] That's what we want to hear. So you're a specialist, right? Any questions </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:18:45] we have this legislation in place quite some time now. but we don't really see effects of it in the sense that if you look at the top 20 of Dutch websites, Everywhere. cookie better switch are not compliant.</p><p>Clearly, do you know why no action is taken? I do know. Do you want the answer? Yeah. the GDPR came into force, in May, 2018. but there's another piece of legislation you might have heard about it's called IPR privacy, which is currently a directive and is. Continuously in discussions to be a regulation.</p><p>the finished presence in C talked about it yesterday again. so we'll have to see when this comes out. the specific city of privacy is that it touches upon any kind of inference. There would be with a device that you own. So placing a cookie, a pixel or a tracker or whatever on your mobile phone, your desktop, your nest, your whatever you want when I'm currently also seeing is that's.</p><p>hello, I, of these technologies that used to be cookie based or less cookie based there's lot server to server connections. Go ahead. And so one of the questions is also would that mean that if I do that server to server woods, you privacy apply. Or awards the GDPR apply. And as long as we're not out of the woods of a privacy, I think there won't be a lot of enforcement when it comes to digital.</p><p>For the moment. There have just been two fines in Spain, like four or five years ago. Not much. And to be honest, as Rick said as well, the technology is not really ready yet. the links between yeah. Far from the links between the consent and management tools and then That these trackers are triggered and things like that also worries me as this entire discussion about consent is driving me nuts.</p><p>And I suppose you guys as well. So I'm not the only one because when you think about it, it's just the start of the journey of a prospect customer. Then what happens? It becomes part of. CRM type of system. It enters something else. So now we're just focusing on that little bit in the beginning and we're not even looking at the data flows afterwards.</p><p>And it's also about the data flows afterwards, but once you privacy becomes a regulation where we will have ideally confidentiality of communications and possibly just consent something on the device, then we'll. So I have to tackle not only the interoperability between those little. Bits and pieces, but everything that goes behind.</p><p>So there's lots of work to be done. </p><p>audience A: [00:21:32] And there's a nice website, actually, a it's a enforcement tracker.com. you can see the fines that are, being handled us, and they definitely get higher and more and more specifically for Spain. I was just looking that we now have 16 fines in Spain.</p><p>ranging from 900 euros, to 50,000 euros. So there's quite some. so you might use it as a resource saying, okay, what are my competitors or someone being, finding my industry, if not, then I can just go. </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:22:03] Yeah. Yeah. Then, another, interesting, sources also, for example, the European data protection board.</p><p>they publish their plenary sessions and what they're going to talk about, every month or something like that. So they focus on kids or there's a focus on dating apps or things like that. For us, it drives also, awareness within the company to say, let's take a look at our client list and make sure that we're on the right track.</p><p>Rick Dronkers: [00:22:27] But to your point, there has been some activity in the Netherlands, I think three months ago or something, a lot of the Dutch bakery. Publishing houses. I've got letters from a doubter type person, skaters about cookie was being not sufficient, not working at all or implemented. So there is, at least there is some activity, but, yeah, that seems to be it so far.</p><p>audience A: [00:22:54] Do we have a final question from the audience? </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:22:56] Yeah, I do have one question. How do you guys personally feel about, data collection? So I can imagine on the one hand we have marketers who are very enthusiastic about all the innovative stuff that we can do. On the other hand, we have for simple amnesty who this week released a report saying, Facebook and Google are far leading or human rights, but how do you guys personally feel about that?</p><p>Okay. I have a straightforward answer, so I love data by default. and I read this article, and I would call it potty data in the guardian about the fact that as women, we cue in toilets a lot. and so I don't have a Fitbit or a fitness tracker, but I would love to have a way to tell Apple, for example, that once again, I'm queuing in the toilets because I am at the sea or terror or things like that.</p><p>So I think data is interesting. To optimize our life. I don't have a lot of choices about this and this drives me nuts. so there's a lot of stuff I don't do. They won't be Alexa in my home. Yeah. yeah. Yeah. Amazon ring or things like that. But if I see the use of it, I will, I think you also can get addicted to data.</p><p>And I think that's dangerous. So we should also educate people about that. </p><p>audience A: [00:24:11] Maybe I'm not getting this because I'm a man, but you want to tell Apple that you're cuing for starlets </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:24:16] us women. We spend a lot of time queuing in the toilets because we spend a lot more time in the toilets. And usually there's the same amount of toilets for men and women at any kind of event.</p><p>audience A: [00:24:27] Oh, that's why you want to use the data for us. </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:24:29] Yeah. Yes. So I want to surface that problem. This kind of discrimination against women when you have a very busy life between your kids, your work. And </p><p>audience A: [00:24:40] I don't think they need data for that. They can just look at the lines and then. They don't need to. It's also data.</p><p>Fair enough. Fair enough. But you don't need your phone. You don't need personal. You can just have a, footfall Mader. I don't know what the word is. </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:24:53] The interesting thing is there are standards in the UK, so there was an article about potty data. Seriously. It exists. There are standards in the UK that actually push architects to think about more cubicles for women, but nobody follows the standards.</p><p>Can you mention that? Yeah. Be a woman for two weeks and we'll have a conversation. They don't follow the standards </p><p>audience A: [00:25:17] for the body standards, </p><p>Aurelie Pols: [00:25:19] the architectural standards </p><p>audience A: [00:25:21] that's shitty. thank you so much. We're out of time. We're gonna go to the next session, in 10 minutes, which will be, get you all seen, already a cofounder CEO.</p><p>and telomeres and we'll have Neil's hammer, go owner and data consultant at the data story. we're going to talk about personalization and as hope to see you there. And, again, prepare your questions. .</p><p>‍</p>",true,25385e4e

In her earlier session that day, Emily said that real progress starts when you put your work online for others to see and comment on which in this case was about Github. Someone from the audience wondered how that works out in larger companies where a manager or even a legal department might not be overly joyous about that to say the least so I asked Emily about her thoughts on that. </p><ul><li>Recorded live with audience (pre-covid-19) at the 2019 edition of <a href=""https://conversionhotel.com/"" target=""_blank"">Conversion Hotel</a></li></ul>",,conversion-hotel,build-a-career-in-data-science,"<p>Emily: [00:00:47] Yes, I should have clarified what I talk about posting things online. It's on personal projects. So sometimes you can clear it with your, the company. so for example, I did a post about some simulation based on problems I was facing at Etsy. And that was fine.</p><p>I cleared it with the legal department. I've given presentations about what I've learned about AB testing, the companies I've worked on, but you definitely want to talk with them. And generally they won't. except you posting their data. So projects where you analyzing data is often where I advise to find some personal projects and some public data.</p><p>Yeah, I </p><p>Lukas: [00:01:19] think so. I literally presented something that I posted online in my talk after. And so it's a great setup from Emily because she was literally, she was talking about the tools and then in my talk, I actually use exactly those tools. So yeah, it's possible. </p><p>Guido: [00:01:35] It's possible. You can do it. </p><p>Lukas: [00:01:39] With property check first and it's probably easier for personal projects for </p><p>Guido: [00:01:43] sure.</p><p>Yeah. I think, Lucas, SRM, checking for SRM might make you feel good. Like, Oh, I fixed all my issues now with, my sample size because I checked it, with the Lucas stool now. No, I'm all good. Right. But there might still be quite some issues with the quality of your sample. Right. So can you give me the name of the few of the more serious ones and how to cope with them?</p><p>Lukas: [00:02:07] So serious problems that would not be captured </p><p>Guido: [00:02:09] by SRN? yeah. And then, </p><p>Lukas: [00:02:11] huh? You still have well, so in data science, I don't, I don't know if Emily's familiar with this, but there's this concept of type one and type two errors. And then someone added type three, which is a type one. Error is a false, positive tattoo is, or a false negative and type three is you answered the wrong question.</p><p>And I think this is a, this is not really a data problem, but it's quite, quite common that people will try and answer a question with the data that they have. So then they'll go, like, I need to answer this question and let me see what I already have. And then they'll come up with an answer based on what they have.</p><p>That's not necessarily the answer that people needed. So, so I think that's, that's something I'd watch out for, but it's not really a check that you can, you can run. I mean, to be clear, like SRM is not a panacea, right. It's not a perfect way to go. Yes. This data is certainly correct. And I can now no longer make any mistakes.</p><p>So it's definitely not that, What it is. It says it's a very simple check that will capture a whole spectrum of data, quality issues. and so there's really no reason that you wouldn't do this. And I think that's the point of my talk, right? If you do one thing, when you're checking out your experiments, you should be doing an SRM check.</p><p>Cause it's so simple and it's, the implications are so broad. </p><p>Guido: [00:03:26] And when you figure out that something is wrong, how often do you actually find out. </p><p>Lukas: [00:03:30] What's wrong there. We actually have the, this was part of our interview. So when we wrote a paper and Alexandre , I had the main author made a, an interview script.</p><p>Of all the questions that we would ask of people that we were interviewing together, they're all data. And one of the questions was how often do you actually discover what is the root cause of the SRM? And they're an interesting distinction emerged, at least in the interviews I was doing, which is people working with clients or agencies would say not always.</p><p>But because they are limited by time and they're working with clients. And so at some point, they'll say what we give up. We have no more hours to spend on this. Whereas people, it might my group and basically said, well, 100% of the time we figured out what it is. Sometimes it takes a year. Yup. Right. But we will always, always, always keep doing, because we take this so seriously and we have time to dedicate to this.</p><p>This is our work, right. This is our. Baby daddy jobs. So we don't have these constraints of you're working with a client and the client might say, well, you spent 10 hours working on the experiment this week. What did you do? And you go, well, I was trying to figure out why it was broken. That's not really an acceptable answer.</p><p>I think in an agency setting. </p><p>Guido: [00:04:47] Fair enough. We already have an audience question and you want to, wants to go to the mic? No, I can go on, I have many questions, but it's up to you guys. So, I think it was Lucas. You mentioned two tools out there that do do </p><p>Lukas: [00:05:02] a good job in, I didn't, I was very pro, so I've ever purposely steered away from naming and shaming, but I don't, I don't want this to be about, who's doing an SRAM check and who's not, I just want it to be.</p><p>I want there to be awareness that this exists and that I think everyone should be doing this. Probably it's easy to check </p><p>Guido: [00:05:23] for, to look at your own tool to see, to find out if they do it or not. </p><p>Lukas: [00:05:27] Yeah. I mean, I think at this point in industry, it's safe to assume that your, your AB testing platform does not do this.</p><p>Yeah. so I mean, as far as I'm aware, there's, there's two, I don't actually use any of those tools. So I can't speak to that their quality, but I think it's safe to say. And certainly once you find one and you're going to find one, and you're going to find something that, that has an SRM, then you know, whether they are telling you about disarray or not.</p><p>And then it's a matter of, I think of convincing vendors that this is something that we care about. Ultimately, we're their users, right? We are the people who use our platforms. If we tell the vendors that this is something that is important to us, And I tried to argue with my talk that this should be important to you, right?</p><p>They need the quality of your decisions should be the most important thing when you're running experiments. And so we should, we should try and convince the vendors that this is something that we deeply care about. And then, but since it's like trivial to add, I don't see why they couldn't. No. Yes. And then that's also like part of the, the, the plugin that I presented that I'm working on is more of a proof of concept to show how easy it is.</p><p>Right. I think on the one hand, I want to make it, I want to provide something that's useful to people so that they can actually use this and they don't have to manually compute a SRM checker, everyone. But I also wanted to show that this can just be simply done and so that no one can say, well, you know, it's complicated.</p><p>This is not this easily. </p><p>Guido: [00:06:50] Emily, so, in your talk, you spoke about, three different kinds of, data scientists. how do I, how do I create awareness within my company? That there are actually three different people. They shouldn't be hiring. How do you go about doing that? </p><p>Emily: [00:07:04] Yeah, one thing I didn't talk about is often for an organization's first data scientists or in a startup.</p><p>Someone is playing all three of those roles, but something to think about there is that they're usually not as high a level as you might get an a specialist. And because often that's not what you need. Usually an organization's first data scientists, they're spending a lot of time, depending on how much data engineering has been done, working on some data engineering, setting some tables up, doing some basic analysis that no one's ever looked at before.</p><p>And maybe part of that is a little bit of machine learning. A little bit of, you know, how big a set up some experimentation stuff. But I do think for a company's, first, data scientists, first couple it's okay to have some more generalists, but not to expect that person to be, I would say like a, a unicorn who's world-class at all of them, because that's actually not what you need at that point.</p><p>Like many, many problems do not need someone with a, with a PhD in AI to solve. </p><p>Lukas: [00:07:58] And I can only speak to my own experience, but, but when I started at booking, there was a lot of low hanging fruit. Right. There was lots of stuff that didn't actually require a PhD to figure out. And you had this great example of a lot of data, science, sciences, actually counting and maybe some division and you can go, you can get a little long way with like proper accounting and division.</p><p>And so I totally agree with Emily that when you're only starting out with this, having someone who's a bit of a generalist. Maybe like a CRO kind of background in someone who has actually done like lots of different things. </p><p>Guido: [00:08:28] I think the story, I think that resonate with me with, with hiring a CRO specialist, which is a weird term because most people are more like generalists.</p><p>you need design skills, you need developer skills, you need analytics skills. ideally you'll have some psychology skills. so there's a whole range of things that you need to have, and you might not find that. Single single person with all these skills. </p><p>Lukas: [00:08:52] Right? I don't know Emily, but this is actually what attracts me to this crowd, but I don't consider myself a CRO person at all.</p><p>But I, when I walk around at this conference, I see a lot of likeminded people. And I think it's because data scientists just like CRO specialists are generalists and they have a wide variety of interests and a data driven decision making is one of them, which is my, one of my. That field, I think Sierra was more interested in the usability side of things or the optimization side of things, but there's a lot of overlap between data science and CRL, for sure.</p><p>Guido: [00:09:24] Yup. Yup. Legos, is SRM basically making multi arm bended testing options. </p><p>Lukas: [00:09:31] This is the third time I've had this one. so, What the SRM check does is compares to the expected ratio against the observed ratio. Right? But when you, when you were using a bandit, what is the expected ratio? Because the bandit is constantly adjusting the expected ratio, </p><p>Guido: [00:09:47] which you shouldn't be doing.</p><p>That's </p><p>Lukas: [00:09:49] what you told us. If you want to use a standard statistics, you shouldn't be doing that, but if you're using a band and all of that is out the window anyway. and so when you're, when you're doing abandoned, the SRM check no longer works, so don't do it. Don't do it, don't use it. but the standard statistics also no longer works, which is why, when you talk to vendors about, banded algorithms and how they do statistics on top of them, they'll often do something like, waiting or waiting the, the different, samples or the health, some way of segmenting the results, or they have some way of having a fixed control group, but they have some additional method.</p><p>Of dealing with the fact that the, the bandit is constantly adjusting the sample ratio, which, which you should do, so. </p><p>Guido: [00:10:28] Yep. Okay. Anyone, </p><p>Lukas: [00:10:33] everyone is just afraid of us. Yeah. So after you were talking about SRM, we can go up </p><p>Guido: [00:10:41] if you guys want to, </p><p>Lukas: [00:10:42] Ruben Sierra manager on dialogue. first of all, thank you very much for the great talks this morning.</p><p>Are you sure both to get her in the funnel right here. Let's see if you can combine the talks. I've been actively tracking SRM for a while already, and it's hard work when you find it to solve the issue. But the question is, can AI solve that issue someday? That's such a good question. </p><p>Emily: [00:11:03] Yeah. I think some of </p><p>the </p><p>Guido: [00:11:05] AI machine learning.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Lukas: [00:11:08] Hey, I, to solve SRM, </p><p>Emily: [00:11:10] it doesn't fucking have some of these checks automatically, right? Like looking at different breakdowns of browsers and other stuff like that. </p><p>Lukas: [00:11:16] So like many, experimentation platforms, we have breakdowns and we do SRM checks on the breakdowns. so that makes finding out if there's a particular segment.</p><p>That's problematic makes it very easy. that's actually the second thing, I think on the list of rule of rules of thumb that we suggest, Microsoft has the same thing, right? So it's sort of step one is you look at the overall report and you see if something's clearly broken. Step two is you go into each individual segment and you see whether there's a particular browser or a particular language.</p><p>but the question here is whether AI would solve this. So I think like if I look at the state of the playing field out there, The reality is that most platforms don't even check. So I think step one is check and then step two would be once you uncover the issues, if you want to help a user understand the root cause, then segments help.</p><p>Maybe you can automatically surface. In the UI segments that are actually problematic. So you could automatically say, well, we found an SRM and maybe it's a internet for six or some seems to be a problem here. So that's something you could do, but that wouldn't, that would be, if we go back to geese talk on, yesterday on Friday, he talks about AI at these different levels where really you start out with rules, spaced.</p><p>Right. That's step one then I think, I think that's where we're at. Right? Step one, check, step two. Think of some rules that you could implement that would make it easier for the user to find these problems, but that's a far cry removed from, from my, I am not sure. </p><p>Guido: [00:12:45] I, I think, I'm not, I'm not a panelist, but I think my personal answer will be.</p><p>Yes, AI will fix it, but they will have wiped out humanity before that. It doesn't really matter. </p><p>Emily: [00:12:55] I also think with AI and machine learning, it's often still very helpful to have a human in the loop. So stitch fix is a clothing company that ships you five outfits, and they do it with a combination of algorithms based on what you say you want and sizes, other information you fill out.</p><p>But then a human stylist kind of picks the clothes that the algorithm suggests and puts them together and writes a note and all of that and sends it off. And so I think there's. Going to be very few problems where it's only going to be, you know, machine learning or AI or AI. And there's always going to be that, that space for a human, with some domain knowledge to come in and </p><p>Lukas: [00:13:27] connect abs absolutely in human, in the loop computing, they also call us.</p><p>And I think there's even a feedback loop there where the, what the human does in that loop is not just. Play part in this one recommendation to this one customer, but they also provide more information for the machine learning. So, so whatever, if this is let's take the stitch fix example, right? So if, the, the human goes yesterday, this is a good recommendation computer.</p><p>We're going to send this and I'm going to add a note. And then every once in a while they go, this is ridiculous. We're sending this person five pairs of jeans and nothing else. Right then that, that feedback right there, that they now have insight in when the algorithm fails and this can feed back into the machine learning itself.</p><p>So the human can say this, this recommendation I'm going to change in this way. And a good recommendation system with, with human in the loop will then adjust, right? It will use that information. So the human in the loop is not just a necessity for the operational element. It's also something that helps the algorithm improve.</p><p>Yeah. So these feedback systems, I really like this about the geese talk that he talked about, reinforcement learning, cause that's essentially what you're doing here. Right? You're you're, you're thinking about this in terms of a improving process, continuously improving, the recommendations. </p><p>Guido: [00:14:45] Can you have a SRM mismatch on session level, but not on a user level or vice versa?</p><p>Lukas: [00:14:50] Yes. Yeah. I mean, so, and Ronnie has mentioned this in some of his papers as well. If you, if you flip a coin. Who gets to see treatment and control at the user level, but then you measure things at the session level. Then any time, more users in treatment will, will generate more sessions. You will essentially have an SRM at the session level.</p><p>And ironically, this is often what you want, right? You want your experiment to cause people to have more sessions, but then let's take a simple example. say that I'm measuring a conversion. so whether people purchase something and I am measuring at the session level. So measuring, how many sessions led to a conversion?</p><p>imagine I have an experiment that makes people who were not purchasing come back the next day and purchase. Now on the one hand purchases will go up because of it. There, these people are coming back, but sessions goes up by approximately same amount or probably more. And so if you look in that instance at purchases per session, it will go down.</p><p>So you sold more, you know, make more money. Customers are probably happy. That's why they're coming back. But you look at the results for your test and your main KPIs going down. So in those cases, I struggled a little bit with a session level metrics in experimentation. but yeah, you can definitely have an SRM.</p><p>At that level, you're flipping on the usual. </p><p>Guido: [00:16:16] Okay. Any more audience questions F a couple more. where does this with you guys in Harry Potter, </p><p>Lukas: [00:16:25] but </p><p>Emily: [00:16:28] did you </p><p>Lukas: [00:16:28] reference him? I told him to </p><p>Guido: [00:16:30] go to that, but you </p><p>Lukas: [00:16:33] had, you had this slip there? Yeah. I </p><p>Emily: [00:16:35] probably just picked someone's arm </p><p>Guido: [00:16:36] Dumbledore, right?</p><p>Lukas: [00:16:42] Yeah, yeah, </p><p>Guido: [00:16:42] yeah. Already is Dumbledore.</p><p>Lukas: [00:16:47] I don't know. It's popular </p><p>Emily: [00:16:49] nerd thing, I guess. </p><p>Guido: [00:16:50] Yeah. Yeah. Well, we have a similar question here and that's how do you have time? I already have enough time writing papers and doing analysis while keeping up with the latest memes. I don't </p><p>Emily: [00:17:02] Twitter, </p><p>Guido: [00:17:02] Twitter, </p><p>Lukas: [00:17:03] sleep less, </p><p>Guido: [00:17:04] sleep less. </p><p>Lukas: [00:17:06] Hmm. I mean, do you want like a real aunt?</p><p>So it was funny. I'm sorry. I was talking to a bunch of academics, and I said, Oh boy, I would leave. I would really love to join academia at some point. Like when I'm tired of industry and a bunch of years, I want to join academia. So I finally have time to write papers and they looked at me and rolled their eyes and said, you have no idea.</p><p>Like we were writing these papers in the evenings. You're laughing. Yeah. Yeah. So, so apparently in academia, it's the same thing. They they'll say you write these papers in your weekends and your afternoon. Yeah. If your time </p><p>Guido: [00:17:37] off and teaching teaching during the day. </p><p>Lukas: [00:17:41] Yep. </p><p>Guido: [00:17:42] one of my final ones. So I'm talking about groups on desks that are not equal. How do you correct for tests? that takes place at the bottom of the page, comparing a group, which doesn't have the treatment at the bottom of the page. </p><p>Lukas: [00:17:59] This is a very specific question for them. </p><p>Emily: [00:18:03] I think, I think what it's asking is, for example, are you saying like, if the control is triggered when someone visits the page, but the treatment's only triggered when someone goes to the bottom, I have a lot more people in the control and treatment.</p><p>I mean, my general answer to that is I always trigger only on people who would have seen the change. So it should be triggering at this same moment for the control and the treatment. so there's like a couple of papers talking about that. I'm also in the idea of like, let's say you're changing the checkout page and you're changing an offer for free shipping.</p><p>And it'll only be a change from what's people would have seen for $25 to $35. And so you want to trigger just on that, because otherwise you're adding noise to your experiment. If you're having people enter who would see the same thing in the control. </p><p>Lukas: [00:18:44] Yeah. I'm, I'm so torn about this topic. So, so, what, so you say it adds noise.</p><p>Why is that a problem? The power goes down, the power of listening. Right? So, so, so the reason I'm torn that, the, you will have less power if you just include everyone in the 600 rest statistical power, right? So you won't be able to pick up smaller effects. So, so the reason that you trigger and the reason that you zoom in is that you want to pick up smaller effects, but it comes at a price and the price is risk, right?</p><p>So, so whenever you do this sort of, triggering that's on the client, depending on behavior, So then, there's lots of things that can go wrong. Cause you're dependent on JavaScript, running in lots of different browsers and they all react differently to user behavior. And so triggering, I think makes sense in sense of increases statistical power.</p><p>So, so there might be a need to do this, but it is a trade off between that additional power and the risk that you take in, in having a. Bias or missing data in your, your measurements. And I think it's really difficult to give like a general statement of here's how you should make that trade off. Cause it really, really depends on what's going to be in that footer.</p><p>Yeah. But </p><p>Emily: [00:19:58] I, but I think you can say probably it shouldn't trigger on, for example, the page load and the control and then like some JavaScript thing and the treatment. Right. Don't always trigger on the, on the same thing and the control and treatment. </p><p>Lukas: [00:20:08] Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I was assuming that was a given. Yeah, no, no.</p><p>So you should definitely, the triggering should be identical. In the, in the treatment they can control and, and, This is actually one of the things that in the paper and the SRM paper was one of the reasons that SRMs occur is when you use different triggering for a treatment and control. And it was, it was one of those that I had never thought of because that's because in the booking infrastructure, if that happens, because we wrote the API and the infrastructure and such a way that this is this an impossible, essentially.</p><p>And, but I talked to partitioners using other platforms and using different implementations and especially. companies using redirect, strategies where this is actually possible that you trigger on. let's say you triggered a control on when you land on the page and the treatment. You redirect, and then you trigger on the page that you land on.</p><p>Now that seems like a subtle difference, but it does mean that if the redirect fails, then these people will not be triggered into it into treatment, which then causes an SRM. that's all you want. You want to be absolutely sure that the triggering is identical. Yeah. Control. </p><p>Guido: [00:21:10] And, the, the article you wrote, was it already published or was that the one pending publication or the one.</p><p>Lukas: [00:21:17] And the, with the paper. Yeah. That's already published. That was, yeah. That was a sample mismatch. The taxonomy and rules of plump. Yeah. I think it was the KDD that we posted that </p><p>Guido: [00:21:29] I'll look it up and put it in the show notes for the </p><p>Lukas: [00:21:31] nice thank you for, thank you. Yeah. So it's, it's an academic paper, right.</p><p>But we, we tried to keep it as. Readable as possible. I don't think it's very, very dense impenetrable material, but you know, I'm obviously biased here. </p><p>Guido: [00:21:46] You can start with the intro and the, and the conclusion and see if </p><p>Lukas: [00:21:49] can, I mean, the other thing that I presented in the talk was I'm trying to provide more usable, directly usable tools like the plugin, like the website, where you can test for SRM.</p><p>So maybe add those to the show notes so people can use them. I'm just trying to get everyone to, to be aware. That this is a, this is a thing because like the triggering is a good example, right? That's something where I'm making sure that triggering is identical in consultant. Treatment is important. And one of the ways that you would figure out that this is not the case is through an SRM.</p><p>And again, it's not a panacea, right? It might not, we might not catch it. but it's, That's a start. </p><p>Guido: [00:22:24] Yeah. So, moving away from, from SRM, it's your job to teach people at, at booking more about statistics and the way you do this is through stories. so can you tell us what it, what are the one of the Liz additions to your storybook?</p><p>So look as well. You can probably tell better yourself, but many it, Lucas is doing this to, have people make it easier to remember </p><p>Lukas: [00:22:52] those </p><p>Guido: [00:22:52] difficult statistical concepts. and it's not necessarily fun. </p><p>Lukas: [00:22:56] but </p><p>Guido: [00:22:57] reading the paper, reading academic papers on it, but </p><p>Lukas: [00:23:00] I've tended to sorry. So booking, So, so in, in booking experimentation, culture is pretty strong cause we've cared deeply about, the impact that our work has on user experience, which we want to make sure that when we have an idea and we put it on our website, that we actually test that it does the thing that we wanted to do, that it works.</p><p>and so I don't have to really do a lot of convincing. Testing is important. but then the next question is how do we actually do this and how do I interpret results? So a lot of the training we do was more around helping people understand and interpret statistics. I think Emily, you do pretty much the same thing.</p><p>Right. and I've tried to use stories, but I haven't really added anything to the, this is like you're putting me on the spot and really added any stories. Cause, cause I, I started doing this years ago and I I'm, I'm just rehashing this theme, the same stories. </p><p>Guido: [00:23:52] So </p><p>Emily: [00:23:52] I can make it a pitch for something else on Twitter for folks to look up, there's a woman named Alison Horst who is going to be, who's just become an artist in residence at our studio, which is a development environment for art.</p><p>And she makes drawings actually. So with little monsters and she shows different, some of them are stats related. Some of them are related to functions and are, but they're really fun. Cause she was a teacher and she found like when she had an introduction to programming classes, she'd show. Some code and she was very excited.</p><p>She was like, Hey, you see all the cool things that this can do, but the students weren't really getting excited and, you know, and it felt a little bit inaccessible. So she started making these drawings since I really recommend looking them up. Cause it's like a great way. I think, finding different ways to engage people while they're drawing.</p><p>Guido: [00:24:34] Yeah. I guess, execution of deals, whereas a couple of those explanations in cartoon form. Yes, you can just, Oh, let's just send them the link. Hopefully they'll get it. </p><p>Lukas: [00:24:44] The thing that, the thing that inspired me to start. Started doing this in form of stories was a book called the what is the P value?</p><p>Anyway, it's a very short, very thick, thin book, and it's basically a statistician telling stories, explaining basics the physical concept. So that's where I got some of the stories actually talk directly from, from the bookstore has this great example of, one night he's playing basketball with Michael Jordan, which.</p><p>Probably not true, but you know, he's, he's the story is he's playing part battle with Michael Jordan and, they do a five quarters. So try to put the ball in the net. and Michael Jordan hits seven out of seven and he hits four out of seven. but that difference is not physically significant. So he's just as good as basketball as Michael Jordan.</p><p>And now I like that example because you laugh, right? You go like, that's ridiculous. But that is what people do often when they look at an insignificant result, they say, Oh, well, there's no significant difference. So a and B are the same. And that is literally saying that you're just as good as basketball as Michael Jordan is.</p><p>So this book is filled with examples like this. And I hope in the talk, the paper I used in the beginning, the pitfalls of experimenting on the web. The, the, I love that paper for exactly the same reason. Cause it's using actual experiments to tell a story about why this particular problem of SRM is so, so problematic.</p><p>And so the, for the, for the people listening to the podcast, that the experiment they ran is a. Essentially showing that thinking about eyeliner makes people lose weight. And this is such a ridiculous conclusion that when you explain the experiment, you understand that this, this conclusion cannot be true.</p><p>Therefore there must be something wrong with this experiment. And once you try to sort of set your mind to trying to figure out what's wrong with it, you understand how this would apply to other experiments that you run. And I really love this sort of storytelling and trying to get people to understand statistics rather than throwing, mathematical equations that them, and then just hoping that somehow they will understand.</p><p>Emily: [00:26:42] Yeah, I do think it's important for those folks listening to the podcast who weren't at the Lucas's presentation to understand that he was trying to mind people putting on eyeliner and he later admitted. He didn't know how people did it. So he was mining putting on mascara. And</p><p>you don't, you don't put on eyeliner, but like waving your hand </p><p>Lukas: [00:27:01] in front of your face. Wow today, today I learned I started so, yeah, so I literally do not know how to do this. We should, this is the whole point of that experiment. Right? Then the problem is that the men drop out of the experiment because they don't know how to put on an eyeliner.</p><p>And then they, they refuse to participate, which is why the SRM occurs. And the same is true for me. Like I have no idea what eyeliner. </p><p>Guido: [00:27:21] Yeah. I feel ankle for a session coming up. Probably not the one in the sauna. </p><p>Lukas: [00:27:29] Eyeliner in the sauna. Would it run like this? Is that the one that runs</p><p>I'm so confused. </p><p>Guido: [00:27:37] Do we have one final audience question or should we wrap it up? Yeah, go ahead. </p><p>Lukas: [00:27:45] I'm a new account strategist as the, </p><p>Emily: [00:27:46] just to marketing </p><p>Lukas: [00:27:48] and Emily I'm just out of curiosity, I'm wondering, </p><p>Emily: [00:27:50] what is your main </p><p>Lukas: [00:27:52] goal, your main motivation for writing your own </p><p>Emily: [00:27:54] book? </p><p>Lukas: [00:27:55] What kind of fishing do you feel like you have to share with you with </p><p>Emily: [00:27:58] the world?</p><p>Yeah, thanks. so for listeners, I'm writing a book called build a career in data science with my coauthor, Jacqueline Nolis that's career advice for aspiring and junior data scientists, and really the motivation Friday folks who who've written a book is it's certainly not financial in terms of the amount of time you spend writing it compared to yeah.</p><p>but really it was cause for Jacqueline and I both felt because it's such a new field, you know, it's it's career paths. Aren't really well defined. A lot of folks may be the first data scientist at their company. They don't have someone to look up to. There's a lot of folks wanting to entering the field.</p><p>They, they try to Google like how to become a data scientist. There's millions of articles. So it's really being the book that both of us wish we had and, also getting some different perspectives. So at the end of every chapter, we interview at different data scientists because we knew. You know, we we've learned a lot.</p><p>We've talked to some folks, but we also wanted to make sure we included a lot of different voices in the data science field. </p><p>Guido: [00:28:50] Very good. Thank you. thank you, Emily. Thank you, Lucas. </p>",,a96cfa38

And thanks for listening to another episode of cafe. And this episode, I talk with Luke Carthy and he will teach us how to use an, the Oklahoma to find onsite or version bottlenecks. And you'll find out why tea and biscuits are a golden combination. My name is Carrie Elsa, and welcome to okay.</p><p>What goes, where I show you the behind the scenes of optimization teams and talk with desk freshness about data and human driven optimization, and implementing a culture of experimentation and validation, I think is your missed it. In the previous English episode, I spoke with Morgan lags. Director of operations and certified partner outreach.</p><p>At comfort, we spoke about the festinating decent realized management molecules or leprosy. And we ended up talking about how electricity also led to convert, applying something that's called conscious business. By for example, eliminating bias in hiring and becoming carbon positive. You can also listen to it episodes, which is season two, episode 22 on this Roca fate or websites or in the podcast app you're listening with right now, this episode of Siracha is made possible by our partners online dialogue SiteSpect online influence Institute and gopher.com.</p><p>Welcome to season two, episode 25. Oh Luke. Thanks so much for joining us. Welcome to the show. And yeah. First question, of course. What makes those mis-cuts so special? </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:01:35] I think the easy questions to ask is what is it that doesn't make biscuit special? they're amazing, right? They're delicious.</p><p>They're just go, we'd see, yeah, they're incredible. I'm just, I'm obsessed with them. They're a bit of a problem. They help me put on weight, especially right now. I don't think I've ever spent as much money as I have during quarantine, on biscuits they're on. but yeah, the biscuits. In the UK versus the U S there's always a big argument, whether I'm talking about British biscuits rather than actual American biscuit force.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:03] since we're talking about UK biscuits, what kind of tea goes best with your biscuits? Does it depend on the biscuit? is it always </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:02:10] not that much of a connoisseur I'll be real with you? so any kind of English breakfast or black teas is incredible to be honest, but a herbal tea and biscuits.</p><p>There's never really a good shot. That's all I'm doing. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:20] That's good to know. when we meet in real life, that's a, I know how to prepare. That's good to know. </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:02:25] Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:26] Sure. onto a more a CRO, a related topic, what is your background and how do you, how are you involved with, zero in the browser?</p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:02:35] Yeah. So I think many people in the CRO industry or in digital marketing kind of fall upon it. I don't think there's many people who set from the outside of going to college and school and saying, I want to do CRO, It's not really a. One of those things. So for me, started on eBay, where I first set up my first year by business, joining schools, I was about 16 and so on phone lifting and it was quite successful, but there's a lot of competition.</p><p>Yeah. And I just did things using therapy, which is like eBay's, AA traps. If you like, what eBay's SEM rush, which helps you to identify key words, opportunities. how you should write your copy images, that sort of thing, to really help improve impressions and sales. And that CRO book was instilled in me from that point, that constant experimentation testing, free delivery, high price versus a lower price and separate delivery costs or.</p><p>listings that have a pack of one versus a pack of three and that sort of thing. So it really started there. and then it moved on into, along with me as part of my SEO career, really. So I loved it. I loved the idea of, finding ways to remove bottlenecks or make our process easier.</p><p>and it's the X just stuck with me ever since, but that's where it really started. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:47] so you do a combination right. Of SEO and Sera. </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:03:50] Yeah, definitely. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:51] Yeah. And that's, that's good to hear at least </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:03:55] interesting mix. It's an interesting mix. I think that the challenges, And I'm sure many people listening can relate whether you're in house agency or a bit of both, Is, Bringing traffic is great and banana well to grow organic performance. This is brilliant, the other side of it that really helps. Yeah. The business has been able to convert as much of that as possible. and I think both of those are hugely complimentary it to the point where normally when I onboard a new client or I'm working on a new project, it's normally CRO I start with, before we look at growing traffic, cause there's nothing worse to increase in traffic and then having a real.</p><p>Big problem or inefficiency. That's costing you sales it's much. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:31] Yeah, it's a bit cliche. They go hand in hand, right? You can't do one without the other. I was working for a company, two, three years ago and they spent like 12 million in Edwards, but they had no idea. And that was mainly lead generation, the website.</p><p>And they had no idea how much ROI or revenue they got from that. it's mind blowing out some companies. just fully focused on one half of the equation and then </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:04:53] yeah, we'll get the other, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:56] so what did you use specialized in specifically in eCommerce? So a trend, a transactional, a website. So w what does that make you tick, on the eCommerce side?</p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:05:05] Yeah, I think it's a bit of a double edged sword because on one side there's nowhere to hide, e-commerce is fundamentally how many sales and average order value and products and everything else. But on the opposite side, it's very immediate. If you like an instance to see where you're making a difference, the rather than lead gen sites insurance and that sort of thing, or B2B inquiries, there's a whole funnel there's leads to nurturing to, a pipeline, what would be commerce?</p><p>even in a B to B environment, people are placing orders and immediately exchange of money. So yeah, it's great to see that journey and it doesn't matter how long I've been in eCommerce, right? The feeling never gets older of working on something and seeing your first fail or working on something and see him.</p><p>improve growth in sales or performance. So that is infectious. I love it. And I'm absolutely obsessed with it. Yeah. but yeah, it goes all the way back to the rebates where I started and it's what I absolutely adore doing. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:54] That makes sense. A bit more fun, right? If you can directly tie your actions to results.</p><p>if you're working on lead gen rep side is usually a couple of steps further where the real revenue, sets. And it's more fun if you can directly, look at the orders or </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:06:09] yeah, exactly. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:10] Today, or we're talking about, this is how to find Shiro gold using a C SCO crawler. And you did a session on that last week at the digital elite live, right?</p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:06:21] Yeah, I did. It was a lot of fun, although there was this, it was really weird because you don't actually see anybody partaken in your event. So you just have to hope. Exactly. Yeah. We're enjoying what you're talking about, but the feedback after the event was great, there was a bunch of questions. but yeah, I, it was my first property.</p><p>Did he talk conference? I think. And, it was interesting. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:38] so what is it about, how do we find Ciro gold using an SEO crawler? </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:06:42] I guess the, to give you the top level as to how this topic even came about, I think. I wanted a topic that would make people think what, like really how, and really instill that.</p><p>I need to find out what the answer to they fits and that apparently worked, it was the reason why I ended up getting, getting through to mascot. It was a brilliant idea. So the way how it works is, CRO is not all about AB tests. It's not necessarily about, variances and controls and all that sort of stuff.</p><p>sometimes CRO is just things that needs to be done. you find a problem, you address it, you fix it. And so to give you a perfect example, one of the things I've talked about is crawling sites search. So as we know, statistically, a really cool reference and post that CXL made is that a third of all will be commerce users.</p><p>On average, we'll use a site search. So it's a fundamental part of a user journey and conversion. So one of the thing that I speak about is crawling your tongue. 10%, whether that's 10,000 or a hundred queries, or even all of them, if you wanted to find out which particular search queries return no results or poor results.</p><p>so a perfect example here. there's a retailer here in the UK called Holland and Barrett, and there are, healthcare brand, but if you go to their site or at least he did, when I, to this presentation and you search for Holland and Barrett, sorry, search coronavirus on Holland and Barrett.</p><p>There's no results. Fine. Yeah, which I find is massively ironic, considering it's a healthcare provider, They sell and sanitizer, they sell paracetamol and all that sort of stuff that helps alleviate the symptoms or reduce the spreading of it. Yeah. and that's a perfect poignant example of how important it is to make sure your site search is satisfying customer demands as well as possible.</p><p>another example there, I looked at best buy. And identify that one of their top searches, according to HRS was online account. So people clearly couldn't find where to find an online account or how to log in. So they searched for that. But on doing that, there was poor results, but no results found. clearly there's an experience opportunity there where someone's searching for online account should maybe be redirected.</p><p>So a login page or, maybe a message pops up to say, Hey, are you looking to log in to find your orders, whatever that is. And it's just finding things like that, whether they're immediate commerce queries, immediate, I want to buy queries or just information or a search queries that you can use to help improve experience.</p><p>And that's. Something that can be done fairly quickly at scale, using an SEO call. That was one of them. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:11] Marketing mergers have some suffers and the sheriff for AB testing has been impacted too. If you want to keep that thing to enterprise standards, but safe, 80% on your annual contract, you can consider comfort with their summer release.</p><p>You can take advantage of full stack and hybrid features, </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:09:29] strong </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:29] privacy compliance, no blink. And enterprise great security </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:09:35] feel good about your smart </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:37] business decision infest. What you save back in your CRO program, check out www adult's </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:09:43] overbook </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:44] slash 2020. How does a SEO crawl or fit into their process?</p><p>just, manually searching for a brand name plus Corona. doesn't sound scalable. </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:09:55] One of the ways in which you could work in a real world situation is to use Google analytics. In this case, you find your top, let's say 10,000 or 5,000 search queries. but every site search will normally have some kind of URL pattern.</p><p>So example.com/search/search query. Yeah. So you just create a file where you have that static, part of the URL Ord slash the keyword. And throw those 10, 20,000 your ELLs into, such screaming frog and do it by list mode. then what you can use is something called, as we've said, custom extraction, where you, tag something that's on the page that you want to extract.</p><p>So it could be the number of results found. It could be a message that pops up to say no results found when you have no results. And what will happen is you'll get a running list. And this is so difficult to explain without visuals, right? But you'll get a running list of the crawl alongside the data you want to extract.</p><p>So to use a very pointed example, you could have example.com/search/um, for an of ours. And you may have that as like your top 10 search in that same row, you would have say no results found in column a. And then column B, you might have something else in column C and so on. So that way at scale, you can very quickly identify what particular search queries are returning, what results and what items and at what prices and that sort of thing.</p><p>so it's really quite scalable. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:19] And, you've already done this. What are the most. yeah. Memorable findings so far. </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:11:24] Okay. Yes. I wish I could give you specifics, but I'm pretty sure I'd get shot by one of my clients, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:31] but more in general, the types of, </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:11:32] there is one absolute goldmine one, which I was amazed that they couldn't find before I got involved in it.</p><p>there's a manufacturer or dessert. There's a, B to B eCommerce client that I have. and they sell one of their most popular brands is something I sell. Now, if you search for that most popular brand, you had really bad results, like really irrelevant results. And the problem was the name of the brand was quite a generic name.</p><p>and I'll try my hardest, not to say, but there, it was a super generic name. So by searching for that brand, you've got super generic results. Yeah. and we're talking in the tens of thousands of searches a month. It was a huge volume keyword. So by identifying that this was a problem, we overnight fixed, the relevance and the importance of that particular key word to really improve the performance of that search results.</p><p>And almost within sort of 72 hours, we saw an improvement in conversion. We saw a sale through of products that hadn't sold for years, that the business just assumed there wasn't demand for, but actually there was, it was just customers. Couldn't find them online. and then it got buy in if you like to go and invest and spend more money and resources on CRO.</p><p>and on that customer experience journey, but it was through finding that real quick, low hanging fruit. And it's something maybe like an hour, like we're not talking a huge project here. That's at month, an hour of research, that really helped to get buy in and to fix one of their core search problems.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:54] Yeah. So what kind of issues do you usually encounter? Is it. issues in the customer journey that like the big differences between maybe the expectations that are, created during the search phase, then only not Matt's, on the websites or is more like a, just like a Mo more product wise, the actual services or products that the company.</p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:13:17] offers. Yeah, it could absolutely be both. It could absolutely be both, but I think more it's towards the latter. to give you a, I guess a, another example, so a lot of companies will have conversations of why is my, why is this particular product or category, dropping in rankings or inversely?</p><p>Why is this particular category or set of products now, all of a sudden, really popular. The, what might do a, custom instruction across every product on their site. If I can, I don't have the best sightings and extract things like price, information, stock, status, product description, product title, and then compare it to SEO metrics.</p><p>The number of keywords it ranks for and how much organic traffic is getting. And as a result of that, I can start to see if there's a pattern. So normally you can find that if things have dropped is because they've been out of stock. Or if things have increased organically because they're in stock or the prices change, but you can start to satisfy those questions because a lot of people will assume, especially in my experience, working in house in the past before I went into consultancy is, why are we getting this traffic here or why we send less of this online, but no one ever seems to think and look at the.</p><p>the core fundamentals for us, which actually we don't have that much stock or we have no stock at all. Or even the prices increased by 25% while other people have it on promotion right now. And just the smooth mechanics of things like that. And the whole kind of, Argument of incremental growth, really comes into play here.</p><p>and even though businesses have all the tools to go and find this information themselves, they know their product pricing, they know their descriptions. Normally they're siloed into different seams. So be able to do custom extraction, bring that all together and bring the evidence can really help to, merge and solidify those filings.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:58] And do you usually use the SCO crawler? is that where you start and then. Figure out where the optimization lies or do you, is it usually that maybe you see something weird in Google analytics and then use your SEO crawl to more or less find the answers or potential answers, for the way of things that you see elsewhere?</p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:15:21] Yeah, so it certainly normally starts in GA yeah. that's normally like a good starting point, but equally, sometimes even if I don't find anything in GA that's particularly. cause for concern or even a real good positive that I want to try and bottle up and an echo elsewhere.</p><p>sometimes it's really good. Should it run some custom extraction anyway, to see if he can find any patents? So one, real world situation is there was a client of mine that wanted to invest in product descriptions, which comes up quite a lot in the world of eCommerce. Do we go away and spend. money time resource on rewriting, a bunch of product descriptions to see if we can improve sales.</p><p>So what normally would happen is I'd go away and again, crawl a whole category or a number of categories and extract their product trips. The, see if I can find a relationship between the length and quality of a product description versus sales performance. so we can try and get an idea whether it's actually going to be a worthwhile investment.</p><p>To spend time, money and resource on rewriting, prescriptions for 15,000 products, or not. And normally the answer horribly is it depends, depends on what you sell. Depends on, whether you sell, manufactured products from brands or whether you're responsible for selling your own branded products from the airport.</p><p>but it certainly helps to either shape. Or bring the cans argument to our proposal that's been brought forward. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:40] Yeah, it feels to me like it's a similar, way of working as you, as I do personally with doing user research, you often see some weird things in Google analytics and then I use user research.</p><p>To drill down on the issue and find out where their real, problems with the users lies. And it's sometimes also it goes the other way around. So you do a user study, then you find out, Hey, that's a weird let's, look in Google analytics. If we can find some data there that's. Also shows this weird behavior or might explain this weird behavior.</p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:17:13] Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:13] So yeah, it's a combination of tools usually that, that's yeah. And that gets, it gets you closer to an answer. </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:17:20] Yeah, absolutely. But </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:21] what kind of tools do you use? we sell it as yoke crawler. In general. Are there any specific tools that you'd like to use here? </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:17:27] Frog? I think I've mentioned a few times is a really good GoTo and it's dirt cheap like to use.</p><p>but I'm also a big fan of site bald. I think it helps just to add some more context around the data. So scrubbing from is great. If you want to just drill into the specifics, the raw data, but sometimes it can help you out. especially if you're working towards a relatively tight schedule or, people aren't asking for a full, comprehensive audit and it can help me just define, issues that screaming, frog don't won't necessarily identify.</p><p>in the CRO space, then I think Hotjar, and heatmaps, and any of the kind of heat map console, there's always a brilliant one, but heat maps, I feel are only as good as the data that you can add to them. maybe when heatmaps first introduced in the early two thousands, Crazy egg hit the scene and everyone was going absolutely insane for this sort of stuff. And it can help paint a picture to see, what things are clicked on. And, we know the story, but where it really gets powerful is if you can leverage that with data and do the analytics with things like custom dimensions.</p><p>So I'll give you an example. logged in versus logged out heat maps and seeing if there's a different user journey that people will take on average, across the whole set of users between a logged in experience versus a log, that experience, or even like a new customer versus a repeat customer, or even been able to drill down to someone who.</p><p>has been looking around for a good one number of times, what hasn't purchased versus someone who is someone who's constantly purchased. And every time they come to your site, because you want to understand the challenges of people who don't buy separately to the challenges or the winning combinations of things that are happening on the site of customers at Dubai, just looking at heat maps collectively and saying, we get 80% of clicks on this page here.</p><p>It is not, Not necessarily going to be helpful, so to segment and really shut down, that heat mapping site can be really quite powerful. Yeah. I think other tools, you mentioned user surveys, Google surveys for all its faults is a great thing to try and use it's relatively low cost.</p><p>there's been situations where I've worked in jobs before tried to get, say Hotjar, in the budget and the answer just been well, not yet. And I've just literally put five pounds of my own personal money just to go and run a survey to almost build a case for why we need Hotjar in the first instance.</p><p>I really liked that, personally, and then I've had, although not recently, but experienced with tools like Monetate, which I've really enjoyed and the personalization front. And that sort of thing, but they're big scale, enterprise level tools, but I personally really enjoy the small, cheap and cheerful tools.</p><p>I just feel to do CRO you don't necessarily need enterprise level staff, right? You don't necessarily need big budgets. And I think that's really important, to make clear </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:07] he has usually, unfortunately it does. There's no one silver bullet tool out there. It's usually a combination of tools as you need to get the insight that you need, right?</p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:20:15] Yeah. For over 10 </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:17] years now, all mine died. Look at Pfizer's about evidence based conversion optimization with a focus on data and psychology. We see that analyzing data and recognizing customer behavior results in a better online dialogue with your clients and a higher ROI that team of strategists, analysts, psychologists, and UX specialists gathered valuable insights in your online behavior of your visitors.</p><p>And together with you optimize the different elements of your zero program through redesigned expert reviews, AB test and behavioral analysis. For more information about their services, go to Owen dialogue. Thanks so much for sharing that with us. and, I think for people that are interested, we can place the link to the, to the recording and, and, and the slides.</p><p>Yeah. From the event, if people want to go over them, the final thing I wanted to talk to you about you'll start the webinar share, right? Yeah. Let's talk shop. </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:21:09] Yes. Yeah. So what are you doing there? Okay. So this was a project that was born out of locked down. and I think, earlier you were bored, basically.</p><p>Yeah. Yeah. I was bored very early on in the lockdown, I'm on the </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:20] board and you wanted more human content, </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:21:22] literally. that's precisely what it is. And I've always quite a. I can't relax very well. So I always need something to keep me busy. Yeah. And in the beginnings of the pandemic and lockdown, I found it really difficult to switch off and try and imagine that things are going to wind down a little bit.</p><p>Yeah. So I thought, New project. but the whole point of this is I'm an extrovert. So it helps me to get some of that out in a webinar series. But also, so there was so many FAQ and so many people that were reaching out and asking me. questions, especially joining, not Danny commerce was screaming up knowledge of eCommerce wasn't necessarily at the same levels.</p><p>So thought, Hey, here's an opportunity to try and put some, insightful, informative stuff around e-commerce side that may or may not help people out. and that's what it was born from. So there's two episodes out there so far. The first episode was a question that I must get asked at least once a week.</p><p>Like probably more so even now, which is. How do I manage my out of stock products? Do I turn them off? Do I do this? Do I do that All of those questions. so that's the first episode. And then the second and one was into a real world case study of paper checks. they migrated to it. Yeah, the new website back in 2018 and even two years on, they still haven't recovered, their organic losses.</p><p>So it was just a look under the hood of what's happening. so first episode kind of a blend of CRO and SEO. And then the second episode is more weighted towards the SEO side. And I might switch it up for episode three. And whenever that man, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:22:46] and any topics lined up already, </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:22:48] I've got a bunch in the QR.</p><p>I'm not too sure which one I'm going to do next. it could be like a, an interview with somebody just to pick some questions. but I think what I'm probably going to work on next. This is faceted navigation. what specifics about it? I don't know. Cause it's one of those things fascinated.</p><p>Now you can talk about it for hours. but yeah, that's probably one that I may a major up until next time. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:08] The link to that in the show notes, I'm cured. interesting, topics to begin with. So are looking forward to one more of those, </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:23:14] and I've just thought of a really pointed example of where. I'd like a CRO thing, CRO slash book fit, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:21] throw it in there.</p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:23:21] Another example, wanting to throw in the world of CRM. And it's I don't know if it sits more towards CRO or book fix, it sits smack bang between but Aaron messages, no error messages typically built by developers, right? That they are designed to showcase an error when something happens.</p><p>It's very rare. at least at a small to medium sized business where you'd have someone dedicated to writing, proper informative copy for error messages. So to give you one example, there's a client that had phone calls, maybe three or four times a week. according to say, Hey, look, I'm at the checkout.</p><p>I've gotten a car. I know there's money on this card. I've used it in the supermarket like an hour ago. and it's not working. I can't pay on your site. So the usual argument comes in where you, the customer service raise a ticket. He goes into the it team, the it take a look, they can't replicate it. And it's just this whole back and forth.</p><p>yeah. Now with this particular issue, what we identified is let's go away and yeah. and call the error messages that happen at a checkout for any given event. And what we identified is when you, enter invalid card number, The error message that was popping up on the screen was something like error, one, one, but contact sales on phone number, which means nothing.</p><p>So no one era wonder below seven. so what I do, David, is I Googled that error message, that output code. And he actually meant when I looked at the Sage pay, API docs are a wonderful Oh seven one one seven, men being fairly common, but so we just changed the copy to say, &nbsp;number, please check your card number and retry.</p><p>And the literally within 24 hours, there was like a 30,000 pound uplift in sales, like on a daily basis. Now you could argue that is a book. that is a, the core thing that just needed fixing, but in my opinion, I think it sits more in the world of CRO because it's messaging it's copy it's experience.</p><p>and I think the reason why I wanted to bring this particular point up is because sometimes CRO is hidden in the most unusual of places. It doesn't have to be an AB test. It doesn't have to be, user testing. It could just be something that's needling the house, that issue that you can't quite put a finger on, but when you get it can make a world of difference.</p><p>Amen. Yeah, absolutely. great addition. No problem. No problem. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:47] Thank you so much for joining. like I said, more information as you're listening to more information on this topic and, in the webinars series, Lucas started. Can be found in the show notes. </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:25:56] Thanks, Luke. Yeah. Thank you very much, man.</p><p>I appreciate it. Good luck. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:59] And, talk to you soon. </p><p>Luke Carthy: [00:26:00] Alright.

I'm glad to be here. I started my company back in 1996, which is quite a long time. So back then nobody talked about it. CRO back then we called it an internet agent. Let's see our web agency and we click quickly focused on user experience. And some methodology, we quickly realized that if you can guide your clients with methodology, they like it.</p><p>So we started with user research and we had some very early aha moments that what we do, potentially delivers a lot of money to our clients. And I think it was back in 2004 when. We started the systematic approach of optimizing a lead generation website. And that was the first client where we measured the impact of her work.</p><p>And it was something like 300 million euros a year. And we were fascinated by that with it. Wow. That makes a big difference. Yeah, but that was still the time of scaling businesses with Edwards. So nobody was interested in hearing our story. ed was actually a tough time, because we thought what we do is really clever.</p><p>But there was no demand on the market. I would say it took another 10 and years, until people really started to care about the economic outcome. Of their websites and user experiences. But my background is, to get back to your question is a user experience, view, and qualitative user research for you, which then led us to the economic outcomes and measuring them.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:39] Yup. Yup. Yeah. And I think, yeah, 10, 10 years ago, and even until maybe five years ago for a lot of industries, it was just cheaper rides to just buy Edwards and throw more users at your website. And it's also very measurable. Of course. that's yeah. </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:01:56] Yeah. I remember some awkward pitch presentations where we presented our methods and it just like a secret door in the floor fund.</p><p>And we felt like we were dropped off. So somebody is right. What did they talk about? Next agency plays and they presented some cool flash intro with animations, and that was really creative and. Yeah, of course they went with that agency and we felt, or we had the impression that we did something wrong, which actually just took some time until, these topics, yeah.</p><p>Got the right perspective on. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:35] yeah. Yeah. I think a lot of, companies now, still, when you bring up the topic of CRO it's, it feels like. most of them right now, I think, and see this as a sexy topic. especially when you throw around terms like eye tracking or MRI scanners or neuro marketing and whatever, but then when you actually do start doing the work, they get bored really quickly.</p><p>cause actually hard work, right? </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:02:58] Exactly. that's a big challenge that, when you do the job properly, it's most of the times it's more work. It's more effort to do it right then. Oh yeah, dude, just do it quick. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:12] Exactly. And that's the topic, what we are talking about today and, yeah.</p><p>whether talking to agencies or clients implementing, behavioral sciences in agile teams. Yeah. That seems to be a struggle for the, yeah. That many companies face. Why do you think that is? </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:03:26] I think it's, normal that, organizations. as they get bigger when you scale organizations or if it's already a big traditional organization that usually focus on efficiency.</p><p>So there will be always somebody that is demanding a tool or, some silver bullets to do the job, or, you'll see, when you go around and companies that focus on agile work and adrenal teams, they have all these. Sticky notes and their offices and a burn down chart. And you see so many things that have an implicit focus on efficiency.</p><p>We are up, people think they do the right thing because they are busy. And I would say the bigger the organization. the more often you see that mistake and, this is why I think nobody. Actually once to do something that causes more effort because the goal of using, all these disciplines that you mentioned before, like behavioral economics, your marketing, and so on, it's more effort to create better hypotheses.</p><p>It's more effort to do proper user research, to understand customer's behavior and so on. It's always more effort. If you want to put that into a streamlined agile process for people that focus on burn down chart, it won't happen as long as the console ya say. But yeah, we do AB testing. We did a couple of experiments last month.</p><p>Some manager will say, yeah, but look, we do a B testing. We, of course we are innovative and we do experimentation and nobody is asking the question, but are you doing it the right way? Maybe it's not about the amount of, sprints you do the amount of releases, the amount of experiments, but maybe it's more about the quality you do.</p><p>and this is something that most bigger organizations, they don't cultivate it. They don't foster it. there is another focus on being more effective. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:39] Yeah. And do you think there's an inherent issue with embedding yeah. Behavioral signs in agile teams, is that. doomed for right from the start or is there a way to make it successful?</p><p>Andre Morys: [00:05:51] It's difficult. no matter if it's an agile or a traditional one, I would say as soon as the organization is too big, it's hard to implement it, on a very. Core level the task is, to operationalize, everything you need to be done and, topics like, behavioral economics, Customer research or song.</p><p>and most of the times they are not operationalized inside these organizations, not inside the, they have their daily send up meetings and Crum and print reviews and retros and whatever, but there is no meeting that asks is that the right hypothesis to test? There is no, operationalized meeting or thing in the process that asks, how do we prioritize this?</p><p>There's most of the times that there people focusing on business impact and they're guessing, they're just guessing what will happen and they're not measuring the outcomes of their work. Maybe they're afraid that it will show them, Oh, there is no outcome, or it's not that positive. So this is why I think it's difficult, no matter what kind of organization, but I would say the agile organization.</p><p>Doesn't have any advantage compared to the traditional organization when it's about fostering effectiveness. So managers that look for the silver bullet, I think I'll know we implemented processes in our organization, so you're fine. And that completely missed the point that this kind of organization is still not focusing on effective effectiveness.</p><p>Also, it should. And it does maybe for small units for small companies, for startups, but not for big ones. And that's a point that I see a lot of times when I work for companies and when we analyze their backlogs and when we analyze it a B test results, we see what they're doing there and just scratching on the surface, but not moving forward.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:03] so what do you think the most companies, should start with doing or executing? </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:08:10] I usually start with a very boring topic and that's the topic of prioritizing. So what we do when we, started working for a client, we look at the existing backdrops and the existing ideas and we try to match. these hypotheses or testing ideas, however you call it, we try to match it with customer behavior.</p><p>we started with a theory. If it's a good hypothesis, then it's able to change customer's behavior. So what do we know about customer behavior? What are motivators? What are de-motivator? So how can you fit your hypothesis to what we know? And what do you see usually is 90 to 95%. All their hypotheses.</p><p>They just start to disappear because everybody, right? Oh yeah, no, it's just actually, usually the motivation for doing that test is we didn't know exactly. Who has the right opinion or who's right. Or if we should do it this way or that way. So then I say, so you're not experimenting, you're guessing, right?</p><p>This is our two, two completely different things. so analyzed through the right view, most back blocks disappear. And at the end, it's only two of three kind of good ideas, but that you have to work on. And then, the people. Automatically start with, what should we do then instead, if these hypothesis are not that good.</p><p>So that's why we start with a backlog analyzing and prioritizing what's inside the existing backlog to realize it's not connected with customer behavior and therefore not effective. Most of the time</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:57] engineers, the emotive. Nicole's your mental boss from the hash and data. The highlights were Oak eye-tracking mouse tracking and scrambled nominees. Fossil left. &nbsp;we compliment online interactive and</p><p>midostaurin emotion, analytics platform, brain beak, digital &nbsp;on deck or . Hannah</p><p>often encounter companies where you need to completely redo their whole, like the KPIs, the way they measure things. I see often that's companies, that try well. Yeah, like you just said, they're AB testing, not realizing that AB testing is just the part of the validation, but you also still need to work.</p><p>Did you do to work before that? but also often that's companies, or at least e-commerce teams, they are looking at KPIs or they don't even work on KPIs that actually benefit the company. They are, they work with trickled down KPIs or very narrow KPIs that they might be optimizing for that.</p><p>but in actuality, they're not really adding any value to the company. Is that something you encounter often or. </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:11:14] Yes. A lot of times I would say, reducing the work to the KPI is like a doctor who's only treating the symptoms and not the cost of a D C. So the KPI is the symptom and the cause is the behavior of a customer and the trigger that you deliver to the customer.</p><p>If a hypothesis starts with, we re increased that and this and that KPI by doing that. I, yeah, I usually start with the first question. So how is, what do you change on the website connected to the KPI? So direct connection between what they want to change on website with the KPI usually is an indicator of a superficial hypothesis that is not based on customer behavior.</p><p>And that's one thing you can quickly implement. I recommend to use a hypothesis template so you can better prioritize because the hypothesis templates should force you to think about the customer behavior. The template should. have the part that you need to fill in. Why does it change the customer's behavior?</p><p>Because if it's not changing the behavior, your KPI won't change. And, that's something that you have to explain to people because they are world of templates and websites and technology and KPIs. That's the only world they know. That there is somewhere a customer and he's doing things and that this behavior is the cause for the, data, your measure.</p><p>So data is always a result of customer behavior. If you want to see it that way, you have to explain it to people. I think it's a biggest mistake. If the experimentation team or AB testing team in companies is connected to the analytics department. of course I understand the history for most companies, AB testing has something to do with data.</p><p>So they ask the data and analytics people to be responsible for that. But actually you're doing experimentation and you're experimenting with customer behavior. So if you can't explain your KPI with customer behavior, you only know half of the equation and you're always changing things superficially.</p><p>But this is something I can operationalize change the hypothesis template, make thing, people think about the behavior that is the cost for the effect your, yeah. You want to see and yeah. Things are changing to work. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:51] Yeah, exactly. I think one of the issues is also that, in an agile environment, you all have companies that are working in agile.</p><p>They have two week cycles where they're ready to deliver something, but I experienced at least a CRO cycle. you can run an experiment, but it's not only about that. One experiment is about a collection of experiments building up that knowledge off of customers. Yeah. That usually doesn't happen within two weeks.</p><p>No. how do you think that fits in? How do you manage the expectation at the, on the client side? </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:14:22] I w I would start with the vision. That means everything that you, ship as a team will be tested. So basically you stay with the two weeks of frequency, but it's not that you're launching things directly or shipping them.</p><p>Everything will be tested through an experiment. So that would be the ideal state from my perspective. So there is no, So you eliminate the problem that you can choose between. Do I publish a direct and nobody will ever learn if it worked or not? Or should I put it in an experiment? Because if you give people that choice, they will always go for instant gratification and saying, Oh, ship it directly quickly.</p><p>We held that it works, confirmation bias, whatever. This is why it won't happen. if you'll let people decide, they always want to ship things directly. I would not give them the choice. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:16] Yeah, exactly. And then, Basically requiring any change or even if it's just a technical thing, everything should be running to the experiment, team.</p><p>but then of course, I think a lot of companies run into the issue that they don't have the capacity to do. </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:15:30] there are a lot of. Companies on the market, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:33] at least when they start. Exactly. Who would have such a company? </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:15:40] no, let me think, but you can scale it starting with a lot of services and companies.</p><p>it starts with the testing tools state they're starting to build on demand services. You can just press a button and somebody will develop the experiment for you. There are small specialized, Companies on the market that builds experiments for you. So you that's just, I always started with the most, over the biggest constraint and that's usually developer resources.</p><p>So if you can solve that thing, if you really want to solve it, you can solve it and just calculate the business case. So how many of your. Releases might have a negative effect or they have a positive seven. You don't know it no matter what, you're not learning from your releases and correct what that problem is.</p><p>And euros versus we hire a company that just makes an experiment out of it. In the easiest case and the best case you will build your own experimentation system and experimentation platform. and you will be able to ship everything as an experiment with no extra cost. You just have to start to do the equation.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:50] The funny thing is that I've mentioned in the, in a podcast before that often when I, when I, you probably experienced a similar thing, when you've you comment a company, when you start requiring the development team to run experiments, most of them, they see it as an extra thing, right? On top of their already existing, probably very busy jobs and adding something to the backlog of the development team while actually.</p><p>After a while they, the development team starts to notice. Hey, but instead of it's not something yeah, extra. We actually, when we validate everything, we can do it in a way earlier phase. So instead of developing something for maybe three months, we can spend a week on running a proper experimental net.</p><p>See it feels, and it saves us three, two and a half months of development. Yes. And that saves, it saves a lot of time. </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:17:36] And that's what I also see as soon as, and that's what I mean when I call it operationalize it inside your organization. No matter if you change your hypothesis template, no matter if you change the way.</p><p>you ship your stuff or deploy it. it's actually something where the change in your organization will affect and change your culture and the way people act. it won't happen accidentally. You have to make it happen. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:06] Exactly. Yeah. That's exactly what we say in the podcast often that it's not, zero is not something, some trick you just do for couple of months and then you're done.</p><p>it's a way of working. It's basically change management. What we're doing, We're changing the way companies think about their products and our websites and how they should be. She'll be making those better. And for you, how do we convince managers and decision makers? How do you approach that?</p><p>If you have a, maybe you're very willing e-commerce team, and then they hire you, but yeah, you still need to convince the manager or decision makers or stakeholders. And do the actual value and not just going for that first six month or 12 month periods working with you, but that day they keep doing this.</p><p>How do you do that? How do you approach that? </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:18:50] My advice is the CFO should always be your best friend. So as soon as you can calculate the value of the work and the value of the change process or the value of the investment and experimentation. and you will quickly prove that it's positive. So it's maybe not the best idea to convince the CEO or the CMO, because they want that their big projects and big ideas where they don't measure the outcome, will still win.</p><p>But the CFO he's maybe the number cruncher and, the guy that is more on your rational side to calculate the business case, he will. have the desire that everything the company spends money for has a positive ROI. And that's what experimentation and CRO, no matter how you call it, stand for right.</p><p>It stands for only make things that deliver outcome and have a positive ROI. And. And save tons of money by not doing the things that don't deliver our eye. So this is my advice. sit together with the CFO and calculate the whole thing from the beginning to the end. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:04] Exactly. And the added benefit of that is that if you work together with a CFO or to BI team, it usually, yeah, as a CRO, a specialist or agency that's hired, or Shiro specialists internally, you're reporting numbers and hopefully things that are better on the website.</p><p>but of course it's. much better if the BI team or the CFO even can confirm those numbers, it accepts, or instead of just you as a specialist saying, okay, we have 30 million extra and then everyone just looking at you. Okay. Yeah. That's nice that you say it's 30 million extra, but we don't see those 30 million anywhere in our pockets.</p><p>Andre Morys: [00:20:42] Exactly. A big pitfall for a lot of optimizers when they claim to have X million euros uplift and then the CFO tells you, I don't see it on the end. You're doing excellent. Yeah. This is why I think, and maybe that's another area w that we should cover, and our talk, because I think there's a lot of.</p><p>A big lack of understanding, of statistic, especially statistics of our experimentation. So there are still people that want an exact value to be communicated. They, you can't talk about. confidence intervals, for example, with them or whatever. and this is a big problem, especially for those companies that only do a handful experiments a year, and they want to be a hundred percent sure that there is a positive ROI.</p><p>If you tell them, actually there is no a hundred percent that they are, so then we leave it out and then we don't do it. Nope. I don't want that. Yeah. So to, work with statistics and tell people about intervals and things like that, I think this is a lot of educational work that has to be done to enable.</p><p>Oh, yeah. Especially the management level in a company to not produce some bullshit results where you claim that you deliver 30 million bucks or whatever, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:22:08] online dialogue.</p><p>just add a specialist.</p><p>At &nbsp;of course. And ultimately Zia salmon Mecho that was hit in the old day lift. When you say, Oh, Hama social websites, sales funnels, and customer journeys. Mia info. Hi, now online dialogue, fentanyl. Besides, the statistics. how do you see, for example, what do you guys report on? that's, there's basically the issue with whole sphere.</p><p>I think that we as zero specialists have full control, usually over the numbers and the experiments, but over a year with running a lot of experiments, yeah, of course the numbers can vary to say the least. so what do you report on, what do you see as KPIs for the whole optimization program?</p><p>Not just one experiment </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:23:06] there's one answer that is a win for both sides. And I say the more experiments you do, the easier this is to calculate ERI. So if you only did one experiments, one experiment, and you want to be sure. what's the outcome, then it's hard. But if you do several experiments and it gets easier and easier, and as I said, we teach people what a confidence interval is.</p><p>We, we try to report our results in that interval. So we say, okay, With an, possibility of X percent. We made that. And with Y percent we made that a result. We can't say you exactly, but somewhere in between as it. And we learned that the more accurate our reporting is and fits to what really happens bottom line.</p><p>The better, people trust in the overall program. So the most loyal advocates and experimentation on our client's side are the ones that can actually see the effect bottom line </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:10] that doesn't of course holds true. when you're experimenting, the Google's involved gets a better when you run multiple experiments in a controlled environment, but you usually, aren't not a controlled environment.</p><p>Things change all the time. how do you prevent, your company or your managers or your clients to say, okay, yeah, we saw numbers go up, but we also did a great marketing campaign or a TV campaign, or for example, there are, of course, there might be clients where the actual trend of the KPIs, maybe the revenue or the conversion rate or whatever it is you want to look at, the trend is going down.</p><p>just because the Martin people have less interest in your product in general, or, a lot of competitors might be joining your market segments. so how do you handle that? </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:24:55] I would say, especially in equal murders, of course there is the big challenge of seasonality. So you have that highest sale seasons where it's all about marketing and sale campaigns with 70% off additional to whatever.</p><p>Of course, we try to encourage our clients to do retest. So we do the same experiment, maybe twice, if we are not sure how it's affected this kind of campaigns and still foremost, are of our clients. The sample size is too small, so we can automatically detect effects like that. So we are still dependent on the information that there are actually.</p><p>Campaigns running. And we try to have a sample that is as normal as possible. So we can claim that we avoided any influence, or we try to avoid as much influence as possible from campaigns like that. Yeah, but sure. if you are in a very competitive market and with the very. fast business model, you will have a lot of these, influences.</p><p>and the only answer is so far that you should retest things, in, during these kinds of campaigns or seasons and outside these, campaigns and seasons to know the real effect, but for these clients where we do it again, we also had the advantage that we then started to think about. experiments that we do, especially for these kinds of highest sales seasons, if it's fashion e-commerce for example, so your roadmap changes and you start to learn what works and what kind of time.</p><p>and again, your understanding of what are the factors that influence your overall bottom line ROI? You get more and more learning. So it's the hardest way to start. With, I want to know our, I have Mike's presentation program bottom line from the first experiment you can't do that. You have to do more and you have to learn.</p><p>And how is it affected by your campaigns? And so the more experiments you have, the more results you have, the more data, the more accurate, your RI. understanding will be. So that's my </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:27:09] comment. And that takes some time, to do that with your clients. And that's why it's really important to them to do the stakeholder is really important for, </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:27:18] for Shiraz.</p><p>Yeah. we developed a special workshop that we do with the management level of our client. We call it RI workshop and we collect all their objections. So what do you think, what influences the RI. How can we create our very own approach to calculate the ROI for you? So we know if we say there's no RI dump, that's not true.</p><p>If we say the result of experiment is a hundred percent DRA also dump the truth is somewhere in the middle. So let's find out what are the factors that we know, and we can cut away. So we end up in this kind of confidence interval, and we explain it to the people. We enable them, teach them the statistics.</p><p>Finally, when they got the reports from us, they know it is what we have spoken about in that workshop. They know, it's it's yeah. The perspective on what might be true or not. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:13] Yeah. Yeah. And like we just spoke about ROI can be in terms, of course, ideally you want to have some uplifts in the conversion revenue is gonna also be in terms of saving a development time or not implementing stuff that are not working.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:28:27] basically we started with the question, how do you get the organization to focus more on effectiveness and standard instead of efficiency? And I would say, yeah, prove them that it's worth it. These exercises, they sound really theoretically and based on statistics and so on. So while this is the tough part, but I would say it's a foundation, to prove this value.</p><p>And if you don't prove that value, nothing will change in an organization. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:59] That's definitely actually a cell. Shiro packages to two clients. I think, I think it was great and also in his course on CXL saying you shouldn't be doing, anything based on the KPIs, if, nothing performance basis always going to backfire, almost always.</p><p>It's also your experience. </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:29:20] no, we sell packages and, I would say the way we sell it to our clients is. pretty much the way I just told you. So we start with calculating the business case and focus on effectiveness and telling, our clients that we need a kind of a proof of concept that focused on, on effectiveness and putting more resources on better user research on better hypotheses on better experiments is worth it.</p><p>And you will always find these. Kind of people that understand it and that will be your advocates to say, yeah, let's do that. Let's give it a try because the way we are doing it right now, can't be the right way. We are just busy and we don't measure the outcome of our work. So we feel good, but actually we see the numbers are going down and we can't change it.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:15] yeah, everyone's feeling good. Except the CFO. </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:30:18] Exactly. Talk to the CFO has stolen your team. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:25] Exactly. And that's a good thing. Another thing I wanted to talk to you about last month, I did a course on, on CXL on your sticky evaluation. first off, I want to thank you of, of course, for putting in all the time, to the, to put the course together.</p><p>so for our listeners, can you introduce the course. </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:30:43] Yeah, the course. first of all, I see a lot of interesting evaluation is just doing it is it's just based on. Gut feeling. All right. So most people that are doing it, they watch your website. They look at the website and they say, I don't like that.</p><p>And I think this is very dumb. you need an objective, give a framework so you can Yeah, but better analyze what are the leavers that you have? And the second thing, as I said, we do a lot of user research. Yeah. And I, see two problems. Either companies don't do user research or if they do use a rich search, they think everything that comes out of user research is valid and that's also not true.</p><p>So a lot of times your users don't tell you the truth. And this is why I came to the conclusion together, with the founder of CXL Institute that, we should have a course about touristic evaluation. That is first. Making this process more objective. and second that filled the gap. so how can I get the answers that my users and the user research won't tell me.</p><p>And I use the example of a big, expensive car. And I say, if you do a user research, Above that car. Nobody will. if you ask, why did you buy this car? Nobody will tell you are too to impress my neighbors. I have a deep complex about my self esteem, so nobody will tell you that, right? So these are, this is a lot about implicit goals and psychology and processes that are unaware and decision making.</p><p>And this is why you need. the Arista gave affiliation to fill that gap. I don't want to say that doing user research is wrong or a waste of time. I'm on the line. Amazing. the kind of persuasive power of your website is, the perfect add on you need. Yeah. But it only works if you have an understanding about your, your customers.</p><p>So that just, this is something I explained in the course. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:32:51] I think in March off the court, I think in the first course, you already, outline you have a table showing all kinds of different, research methods and they all have pros. They have cons some are more and more better than others.</p><p>And it helps to combine different sources, right? the more sources you have, the closer you get to the proof to the truth. And, of course I think there's a huge bias in our industry. I think, to look at data from Google analytics, cause everyone has it. that's use that. Of course then you know exactly, what people are doing, which I have no idea why that's, why combining different methods.</p><p>and especially when you're doing your stick evaluations is so valuable. </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:33:29] Exactly. I have that picture. I think it's also a slide. And then the course where I say the data is like the shadow, it's a projection of the user's behavior. if you have a light and a user that projects, an outline of the user on the wall.</p><p>It's not the user or it's not the behavior. It's just the result of the behavior. And, seeing the whole picture is much more than just the data. So this is why I say, if you have the data, if you do use as a research, N do you have a good understanding about your users behavior from. For example a year is to give a real evaluation.</p><p>Then you looked at the same thing from three different angles, and then your overall picture might be much more valid than if you just use one method. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:34:17] Becca uninformed ends our beta test and happy Oak lost from the beginning of flickering. AFL yachties did come through. The key test was not to be included and imposed.</p><p>If test tells that no, Tyler, Sheila. A convert comes our beta testing software. The smart insert that'll hit about any flickering of &nbsp;faith gifts. Now that our support fee a 24 seven chat, the health would go up and dive is the last minute. If it's 15 key carbon positive, you do this yourself. You have a knife and the fork and the clean and artsy and plus year during</p><p>And, and of course you also introduce your framework for doing this. Can you do short introduction of Lamont? </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:35:01] Yeah, the framework is, called the seven levels of conversion. And it's very old. It started, as I said, we started with user research like 20 years ago. And, the framework work was foreign.</p><p>When we presented the results of our user research to our clients, we were searching for what are the top. headlines are the top topics that have the arrows that are cure or the potentials we always see. So it was by aggregating the results of dozens, of these kinds of user research researchers.</p><p>And, it led us to, seven days from topics. So it starts with a relevance. So the most. Or the problem we see the most often is that, websites have a lack of relevance for the user. And that goes on with trusts. So people ask themselves can I trust this company that will ask, where can I click?</p><p>Which is the third level orientation, and so on. So you can. say it's a checklist of the seven in our checkmarks that people have to do before they are ready to buy something. Actually it's only six, six check marks because the seventh one is something that most of the time happens, after the purchase.</p><p>but basically it's like this. I would say inner dialogue or an explanation of like inner factors inside the customer's decision making process. that's the model. And since then, I think, early two thousands, we, we started working with the model. a B testing came later and building hypothesis.</p><p>And so on that came later. But right now the model is validated with kind of thousands of AB tests. And, we are still working with that. We get a lot of positive feedback. and the German market, a lot of companies are working with the model. And now that I published it on CXL, as a course, I also get a lot of positive feedback from CXL.</p><p>Yeah. So I'm happy that it's useful. It's simplifying. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:37:08] Exactly. And stood the test of time. That's good for us. </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:37:11] Yeah. like every model is not the truth. It's just a way of simplifying the truth though. your work is going to be easier. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:37:20] It was a, the saying again, the old moles are. Are bad, but some are more useful than others.</p><p>Andre Morys: [00:37:26] Exactly. Ours. I, and of course my friend, Chris scoured with his lift model, it's similar to that, but, the lift mob model has a plane and I see it. It's sticking on a lot of office walls, because for people it's very, easy to understand the plan. I said, damn, when we started our model before got a plane or something,</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:37:51] you can use the car, </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:37:52] maybe a car. Yeah. Yeah.</p><p>Exactly. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:37:59] Yeah. Yeah. So we'll definitely link to a next one. Yeah. The model in the show notes and also a link to the course CXL of course. yeah. thanks for all, for sharing this all out with us. One final question for you, of course you, you don't need to be inspired to run AB tests because you do a proper research for that, but then, but in general, for you, for your work, where do you get your inspiration from?</p><p>Andre Morys: [00:38:24] same most of the time from psychological, models or points of view that help us to understand customer behavior better. some of the best. Hypothesis for optimization came out of workshops, where we teach our clients to use persuasive principles or to use methods, behavioral design methods, build personas, whatever, everything that helps to understand customer behavior, I would say is thinking always, and ended up with better hypothesis and better results.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:39:02] Yeah. Actually meeting the clients. So the actual users can be very eye opening. often of course a clients might expect us to be the experts in whatever they are setting, which is often also not the case. they're the ones selling bicycles or clothing or cars, and we're probably not.</p><p>we can tell them how to get the best out of your customers and in the process run them. They're not necessarily the experts. In and out to sell bicycles or something. </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:39:31] And that's good because I would say it's even the other way around our clients, they know too much about their customers.</p><p>So not knowing that much is the foundation for seeing the user experience, the way their users see it. As a product owner, as a UX guy in the company, you can't see the user experience anymore as a customer sees it. So I think that's a big advantage. Some of our clients told me, Oh, you can't start with the analysis of our website.</p><p>you didn't get the briefing. And I said, yeah, thanks, God, we don't have it so we can better analysis. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:40:08] Yeah. Yeah, it's not personal for us. </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:40:11] Exactly. Thanks Andre. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:40:13] I'm glad you had the time to talk to us. </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:40:16] Great pleasure. Thanks for having me </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:40:19] conferences or, or, events that are, will be, we could be seeing you in the next </p><p>Andre Morys: [00:40:23] couple of months.</p><p>Oh, I don't know where you will be seeing me, but, there it's the obvious conferences that I'd like to recommend, go to. Conference where you see, people that are on the same job as you are.

That's where we need to start. Why are we listening to you? Some people might know you from Twitter your CXL courses, your articles but for those who don't can you please tell us a bit about your backgrounds and what you're doing in your daily life?</p><p>Sure. And also that thanks a lot for having me here. This is awesome. Here's my authority pitch. So for me, I'm a specialist in using behavioral science and psychology, and I temper a little bit with a neuroscience and my shtick is looking at how this operates in a digital mediated environment.</p><p>So that means in websites and mobile phones, Tech and actually my background was in social change. So before I got into pure, like online change, it was all about changing population level health but using technology for that purpose. And then later on My career, got a little bit more interface focused.</p><p>So getting more to like the UX and the front end design. And one thing I could add is I'm not just a academic ivory tower theoretician. I am, I work hands-on. So actually I worked for many years in tech. I was a network admin at one point in my career. I program at PHP Python. I build all the technologies.</p><p>I do all my ads. I worked frontline. So I actually do all implementation. So I'm not like, high level theoretical person. Actually, technically I am, and I have the scientific papers to back it, but I, if I don't get my hands dirty, I don't feel like I'm learning. So I, and I make sure I'm up with the latest.</p><p>Stuff. I heard my next life will be a developer actually. How do you go about mixing those two? Is it like, is it so completely split? You spend two and a half days of the week on theory, two and a half day, a week on practice, or how does that work? Yeah, I think it can be a little tough. &nbsp;Maybe I can tell you about that in my career.</p><p>Cause also I get approached by a lot of people who want to work in the area, similar to where I operate in this. And it's just, it's an intersection between psychology and tech, right student it's like an overlap. So in my career I. I'm a creative person and I have a lot of ideas. So I always push my bosses and I was throwing forward ideas.</p><p>So I could, I can somehow get that integration. So I always found jobs where I was working in the two. So some jobs were more like pure technology. And I was never fully satisfied with those and that some were like pure behavioral science. So I was working in crime prevention for the federal government of Canada, and I couldn't get my team to do anything digital.</p><p>And eventually it was like, eh, this has taken me off. Girl science was not fulfilling. I, and most of my career has been about the two. So I. Let a career like this. So that means you worked not just with the implementation, but the strategy as well. So that psychology gives you the insight and the strategy and gives you the the wisdom in how you implement.</p><p>And the technology is about mastering your medium. If whatever Jimi Hendrix is a master at playing guitar. Rembrandt master at painting Abba masters at singing masters at different crafts. So for me that the tech is like you would have straight strategic insight with no ability to implement, right?</p><p>If you only had the tech and if you only have the strategy, it would all be theory with no ability to implement. So you need both. Yeah. And I think when a lot of people listening to that podcast theories are mentioned quite often we often talk about it's either BJ fork or Cialdini, of course.</p><p>There's this whole list of behaviorally economics Ghanim on of course is what we talk about. We have this amazing list of a couple of honors cognitive biases on Wikipedia. What's your view on these? How do these all relate &nbsp;and how do you work with them? Do you work with them?</p><p>Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So th those are popular theoretical frameworks and models. And &nbsp;but the way you work with a theory is, you'll have to understand its assumptions and background and what a lot of people don't understand, and they get pushed around, like someone who's not really street smart and hasn't been around the block is they tend to buy into some of the dogma.</p><p>And a lot of the assumptions, but when you work as an academic in behavioral science, you say, Oh, it's just that theory. And that theory has these assumptions and it was designed for these applications. And normally it has these principles that are it's building blocks and there's a lot of other backgrounds.</p><p>So you approach them as different frameworks that generally serve a purpose and a different area of applied psychology. So Cialdini developed a system that was for sales psychology. What people don't know about Cialdini is I understand. And his doctorate, he started went undercover with what we would probably call to date, very sleazy sales strategy style, and like high pressure telephone sales, stop that you might have a moral conundrum with it.</p><p>You're working or you will have very good defense mechanisms if you don't like cognitive dissonance. And you're crossing some of those ethical lines but that's where he did his research and need to still principles. So Cialdini developed a system that. Was basically structured around that one application but you would never, ever dream of using Cialdini's framework to build a health behavior change app, right?</p><p>Like it's great for conversion optimization because it comes from studying the psychology of sales, but it did not come from therapy. And then BJ Fogg's model is a bit more of a he has a bunch of models, right? So it depends on what one model, but let's say the Fogg model, because that's what most people are talking about.</p><p>So with his easy and ability framework so BJ actually, he's an interesting player in the behavior change space because he, I was actually at the conference. I had a series of conferences and I felt like he was playing one on us. So BJ was trying to climatize a lot of people in the persuasive technology academic.</p><p>Community, which is actually a very small community of scientists. And I think he tried to get us on the behaviorism. Like I remember when he confessed, he was a behaviorist and all his like crying. He was like coming out, admit I'm a behaviorist. So he really brought behaviors back into the fold because it was very unpopular and he distilled very basic principles that are required for almost all behavior change.</p><p>So his framework is a very broad one. So basically I would say violate BJ Fogg's principles at your peril, it's a general. Set of principles that apply to most situations. It gets into the core of how like our dopamine circuits and how we enforcement learning operates. This is how humans insects, I believe plants as well.</p><p>Micro organisms. It's like how learning operates, right? Like he's really difficult core principles and his core principles are actually not his. You'll find his core principles in a number of other frameworks. &nbsp;But he put them together from a behavioral perspective. So with with his approach, it's like pretty much standard practice.</p><p>You should always be using it. Cialdini has got like the set of principles and we could go on and, there's a different story for each of the things. Yeah. And for me, it also feels &nbsp;the BDA folks are way more. Like I said, it's way more basic in, in how things function. How are organisms finishing?</p><p>Because when you look at the child anyone's there we more influence also by by social changes and they're not so basic that they're not influenced by that. For example, social proof of course, when he was this pretending to be the sleazy seal car salesmen. And doing this maybe in, in one-on-one situation, his book is falling from 1983, there was no online. &nbsp;But now when everyone's getting used to this seeing 500 people reviewing a product very positively probably doesn't have the same effect anymore. Yeah. You don't necessarily believe it anymore. There's some skepticism consumers now. Yeah. Yeah. You could only use a persuasive design strategy for so long before everyone figures out.</p><p>What's. Going on and then they become street smart ag. I don't know. Do you travel much or have you been to not in the last year now than before. Yeah. Yeah. So I traveled a lot. I filled up a number of passports to the point of having no pages left and I backpacked for 10 months when I was at 23.</p><p>That's when I did it. Yeah. So I went to a lot of like places that were like dangerous and new. And I remember the whole thing of being, they call it fresh off the boat. Like when you arrived, people try to exploit you because you don't know the games and the culture. And all the scammers are on you.</p><p>And after a while you get used to dealing with it. And you know how it works, but you don't know how the tactics operate and how the strategies operate until you've been. Been there a while and you're a bit street smart. I think it's the same with marketing tactics. So if you overdo a persuasive design strategy or behavior change principle, and we could get into, how we even call these things, so what we call them, but if you overdo them with an individual, yeah.</p><p>Th they're going to know how it works and then it's going to lose its impact. If you. Poorly implement them. Say you, you overdo it. Like Cialdini's principles are very effective. Like just because they came from like more aggressive sales strategies, because there's nothing wrong with them.</p><p>Actually. I think his principles are very high level and generally applicable. They're just not useful for. For everything. But if you overdo his principles, you will generally look like a sleazy hustler. And so you have to keep it tasteful and how you implement. So it's &nbsp;they say, what does what does a great.</p><p>A work of art. It's like a art. Sorry. A great work of literature is a good story. Told. So the story is like a generic plot narrative. And we humans have been saying the same stories so long. We don't get bored. We never get bored of those stories are wonderful, but we get bored of how those stories are expressed.</p><p>And we always want to hear it. We told them. From our generation's perspective. &nbsp;So how do you take that principle and translate it there's a lot in the implementation. &nbsp;So you can overdo a principle and you can overexpose a population to a principle. And here's the dangerous thing. If our principal becomes associated with con artists scammers, which I think many of the principles of psychology that are taught CRO.</p><p>They get adopted in that way because or saying, Hey, that's worth all these people are doing it. And then these things get built into all the templates that are distributed. And so most of that really effective psychologists, you based principles have been mainstreamed into the design patterns that we all pull from and then take it into the hands of sleazy individuals.</p><p>Boom, you now start destroying them. And now what was a good social norm gets perceived as a threat or as a lie and then good luck. Yeah. And I think we can mention with travel that's a great way to the further away you travel from from where you're based and then what's normal to you.</p><p>Yeah, the more basic you get with what works for you, and then you get to see the world in a different way, and then see, you have to revisit all these biases that you have. And. Figure out if they still work actually for you. As simple practical example is that's part of the world drives on the left side of the roads as part of the world draws on the right side of the road.</p><p>It's not necessarily that one's better than the other. I was just like a default that we've chosen to live with. Then there are, there's a lot of those and. You're under, you're probably not aware of most of them, at least not all the time. And unless you start traveling and then you'll figure out, Hey, this is the way we do.</p><p>This is not normal. Let's let's I need to refigure re &nbsp;when we compose my brain to work in this new situation. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. &nbsp;We have bitchy wait to things, so we get used to everything around us and when something's very different. We don't know how to interpret and it really stands out.</p><p>And when it comes to design, I think also th this this impacts on like marketing in general communications for anyone CRO and that basically if you're copying what everyone else is doing, and if there's a popular psychology book that has some strategies that says, Oh, do this and that Mr.</p><p>Magic, psychological formula for getting higher conversions. Once I grew up, does it. It stops having impact. It's like an arms race, right? So that's now the baseline, people get used to it. And then your messages start habituating like phasing and the danger is that you, you get habituated, you get used to those things really fast.</p><p>If you could move to another country, they won it. That might even be scary, but you're probably used to it after a week. And that's at the same I'll show. I think for as a CRO specialist, when I'm working for a company the first day you might still see you all things wrong, but after a couple of weeks you get used to, okay, we do this because it's.</p><p>It's easier for the backends. It's easier for for marketing to do with Israel, because this is how we do it this way. And that's why I love doing a user research, actually sitting next to people or watching people go through a website or using a product because it brings you back in it States.</p><p>This is a very similar experience to me then moving through for the first time to a new country and that first day, and then, Oh shit. That's. Why are we doing this? This is stupid. I didn't know. And people may people see this in a totally different way and it opens your eyes and see your own product or a website again, through someone else's eyes.</p><p>Oh, yeah, I totally with you we all become blind to our imperfections at some point things from the user's perspective that you can start saying Holy crap. Like I don't do you ever, I have like also times when I have a problem on a page, I'll go on, I'll watch a couple of clicks sessions and see what's going on.</p><p>And a few times I was like, Oh my God, did I just sign that? Someone was on the phone and then they reached a certain point in the process that was like, Oh my God. Okay. Now I know. And you're like, yeah. And you. You, sometimes you won't even use software and in ways that are like you can't conceive of how your users will use your software, they will do things in ways that are inconceivable and only the user testing and getting in at the graphically behind them and seeing what they do. It's like the only way. Yeah. Especially with, if you're designing something you use, one of the default assumption is, Oh, okay, it's going to be on a website or you're using a browser and this is the only thing they're doing right then, or right now.</p><p>And usually that's not the case. They have a couple of browsers open and they're looking on their mobile phone. Then they're stopping midway to get loan insurance. That's usually not, that's even hard to replicate in a user studies of course. But even without debts it's very eye opening now usually to do that.</p><p>So I'm wondering, so when you start, or when you brought in for a new project, you have a very strong foundation in both the theoretical part of the behavioral science and the practical parts when you started, what do you start. It's, I guess it's hard to completely keep them separate, but do you start thinking about, okay.</p><p>Start thinking about theoretical models and how can we solve that? How can we validate it with data? Or do you say, okay, we have this problem. Let's first look at the data and then see. If we can find some theory that can help us out here. I always start with reality before I even attempt to throw in anything theoretical.</p><p>It also depends on costs as well. Cause sometimes if you scope out a project it's &nbsp;and you agree that we're going to use. This tool for that problem that, you agreed to some degree on the models. &nbsp;And actually maybe I could back up and introduce something more complex to the equation.</p><p>So there's a researcher named Tatlock who looked at expert predictions and he spent many years looking at experts in what they. Predicted Tetlock is probably the brother of Dunning-Kruger</p><p>well to the psychology of naive optimism. So when he looked at his experts who make better and experts who make worse predictions, and he said, and this is one of the funny things. So the experts who make the worst predictions are the ones who are really confident. They sell you all black and white.</p><p>This is how the world is. And they look at the world from a frame of reference and they come with a sort of theoretical model that answers all the issues of reality, right? From their perspective. They're one, one, one view, or one trick pony perspective on reality and how to frame everything. &nbsp;They tend to have pretty crappy predictions.</p><p>But they get most of the media attention. And when things don't work out, they tend to, develop skills and rationalize it. Things. The people who make the good predictions are those who look at the evidence and then play with a bunch of different models and say it's like this, but a bit like that.</p><p>And, probably work out. I'm about 80% sure that this, and they come with more of these qualifications &nbsp;and they're more flexible. They tend to have more accurate predictions. But the media hates them. And I think those people, and I'm one of those they tend to get you don't do as well in your business for winning client jobs.</p><p>You're not as strong as speaker because you're willing to look at reality and negotiate and be flexible. So it counts against you. And I think the market wants the one trick pony to come with the magic formula. So I heart, are you radically against that approach? So I look at the situation and then I come up with a model that is going to make sense.</p><p>In most cases when I teach, obviously I have to, I train people through models. But I don't train them to actually take anything off the shelf. I teach them to look at reality and then to compare models. And when you worked for many years in behavioral sites, you're, there's no such thing as we apply Cialdini to everything, which is what a lot of people do or you mentioned hundreds of behavioral economics principles, right?</p><p>There's these crazy lists. Which I can get into later, why I think they're completely absurd and actually had no scientific merit, I believe. And I could get into that. Why these over a hundred lists of behavioral science principles are actually largely baseless. &nbsp;But you could come with all these tools and then you could look at all the models.</p><p>So the health belief model, the theory of reasoned action, the extended parallel process model, you could take BJ Fogg's model. You can take the transtheoretical model, the theory of reason to actions and plan behavior. And I could go on, I can keep rattling off frameworks, but what you do is you have to pick the best models for the challenge.</p><p>And in that's not even enough. Now you have to adapt that model because the model require a little bit of calibration. And then what happens when you do that? Is if you fit a good model to a specific situation and it's really a good fit, then you're you set yourself up for better odds of success.</p><p>But if you come with a pre-fixed model, you might be using the wrong tool for the job. I don't know. I mentioned someone comes in for medical care and the doctor just boom, a penicillin or something.</p><p>Yeah. Yeah, exactly. But I do wonder, so I do feel sometimes that person in the room that's everyone's making decisions or assumptions and then yeah, you're the one saying. Yeah, but Mel not really. Weekends really be sure. Or have we validated this or why on earth? Do you think it's like this?</p><p>And but I think I hear from multiple segro people, they feel a bit the same, right? That you're the person in the room that's well necessarily negative Nancy, but. You're the one being critical about all those things. And that's basically what you're saying, right? That this the more experience you have in this, the more.</p><p>No more uncertain actually you become more &nbsp;it's quite a humbling experience to see all your predictions feel all the time and do these experiments over and being confronted with being wrong. So what would be your advice for zero people in handling this?</p><p>How do you approach this? &nbsp;To do not be seen as the negative Nancy or feel like a negative Nancy and be more, maybe more productive or more contributing to these situations. I love that question and I never I didn't expect you to ask that and it's a wonderful one because that's actually the reality of what most people who work in any sort of like applied psychology, whether it's.</p><p>More informal and more formal. You're going to face that once you're working with other people, you're asking for actual evidence. And then when you put forward, evidence-based design, conventions and strategies. Now you've got the challenge of getting other people on board. And, maybe I can start off with a bit of skepticism about human nature.</p><p>So I think it's generally human nature to conspiracy theories and I don't nonsense and high status pride or sorry, ho high status backed arguments. So that means the highest paid person's opinion will generally outright. Even if what they say is of no merit and whoever calls out the emperor for having no clothing.</p><p>If they're low level in a institution if it's a healthy institution maybe there'll be listened to. In many cases, there'll be ignored and in an unhealthy organization, you could get turned on for that. So it's always risky when you want to stand up for what you believe is right in the situation.</p><p>And maybe I could add one thing. &nbsp;Now have the credentials, right? You don't got the PhD and the long career and the big clients and all that. But I started in the trenches working my way up and I still, I sometimes. Like I work at a higher level, but I still have to deal with the same things.</p><p>And how do I get people trust me more? Cause I spent my years and I can, normally rationalize my arguments for things and explain them in a calm way that people understand. But I paid my dues when I was younger. I had a lot of all my ideas rejected when I worked in the United nations, I actually did a television commercial with Kofi Annan who had just won the Nobel peace prize.</p><p>And I was the one ultimately overseeing a TV commercial, put out. And my boss did not walk me to pilot test it. And I was like, we're putting out a TV commercial where the United nations, this thing is going to get played. We should maybe, and my boss was hostile. He was a game since I have BS and just whatever get out of &nbsp;so me and my friends.</p><p>Came up with this crazy idea. And because we're the UN and we're doing this a public service announcement commercial that was going to go around the world. We translated it into it was like English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian. Cause you know where the UN those are the official languages.</p><p>I'm not allowed to pilot test it. We didn't know some of the creative in it. We didn't know how to do so me and my colleagues, we came up with this scheme to run a secret, a lunch session where we've got people who represented all the cultures of the world. So we got some of our colleagues from Latin America, from North Americans, some Europeans, Africans, Asians, we've tried to be representative. So I created a representative. Like a cluster sample focus group. And then we did a secret lunch pilot test on this day. I got it. It was the funniest thing. So I started in behavioral science, like early, like I started in 1997. So this is pretty early.</p><p>And I was using tech then, so I had, I was undercover. Like now there's an appetite, but I actually operated in hostile environments where I, I come out my performance evaluation for having dare, done pilot testing and validation of creative. So basically the advice for for force heroes that find themselves in this situation is one build on your authority and to build a secret life where you can do test and the one that was about, but you can still, that's your advice basically build a second life.</p><p>Yeah. That's par for the hostile environment, there's started like 20. There's a goal right now there's a culture. So by today's standards yeah, let me give it like a more updated version. So for it, first of all, it could be your background, right? Cause I'm like, it's easier for me. Cause I, I spent my most of my career in this area, so I know the arguments and and.</p><p>It's hard to pull the wool over my eyes. If I think someone's being unfair and manipulative I'll see through it fairly quickly, but assuming everyone's sincere and straightforward what the best thing to do is to first of all, study your subject as seriously as possible to, obviously know your situations.</p><p>Cause the last thing you want to do is to get into a conflict with someone where you get to arguing, spat Okay. My biggest advantage. And this is a very weird one. &nbsp;If it's something I think many people should aspire to, I know Peter, you have a really strong background in behavioral science and you can probably do this.</p><p> Often spot people's assumptions cause I do a lot of training and I've worked with a lot of people hands on. So I work with UX designers, graphic designers. Like developers. And I know when they don't understand the key lesson in psychology. And I'm like, Oh, this person didn't they never learned gestalt.</p><p>Okay. I'll teach them. So they're arguing with me and they have a point of view cause they don't, I know they have, they don't understand basic gestalt design principles. And so I could say, &nbsp;think that. Project, could benefit from gestalt and I'll try and educate them and show them.</p><p>And then I'll frame it saying, Hey, maybe we can turn this into a learning experience. And then you could come back to me with your creative, but try it, try and get these proximity principles and a few other good stall principals in and see what does, and now, instead of, this being a standoff.</p><p>I'm helping someone with their career and their skills. So that's pretty much a win-win now in the future. I've addressed a problem. &nbsp;Often turn things into games like that. So also like a CRO person I'm with. All right. Normally CRO people are good, they tend to know the high level stuff not the details.</p><p>And I find most people that if it's a legitimate, &nbsp;if they legitimately don't agree, cause they don't know something. &nbsp;But there's like learning involved. They're offered like for it. The other thing is turning testing into a game. I like to have fun so we could see probably where I put out and how I do secret pilot testing.</p><p>So I really I'll ask people what. There are theories are it's sometimes I'll even give them a few principles to play with and say, Hey how would you do the creative for this? &nbsp;Let's say we use a social norm and something called the efficacy message. So a confidence boosting message.</p><p>We say, you know what? We think that. We're missing a social norm and efficacy message from this. Isn't what happened in good creative. And actually I try not to come up with the creative, I just give them the strategies. And I find a lot of creative people. They love that. It's a bit like a game for them.</p><p>They're learning. And then what happens is now your AB testing is now eh, let's crack it open and see who won or something. Fair enough. That's so much fun to have fun. I lost, I have lost a CRO Wars or with one person once it was a senior developer, he kicked my butt on a logo designed concept.</p><p>So I'm, and then here and then he's Clouding loser.</p><p>You're good. Other is also education and creating a culture. And then you, if you do things right, you don't be that person who's in the room being, trying to stand up, change your battlefield months in advance. That's probably the easiest way to do it. Ma'am have you ever the culture that career in in in games and gaming?</p><p>No, I not a big game. I have a colleague, Dr. Shad Rowe sees a game of education and education specialist. He's, he plays like a where our world of Warcraft at night. I would cold Turkey. I think about the age of, I think I was 27 was StarCraft. I said that was it. I will never play this again. This is crack right talk at the time, but it was like horribly addictive &nbsp;and that's it.</p><p>So I go voided games. So probably not mine. Good. Hey We were just, you just mentioned the we just spoke about those those principles to cognitive biases, the enormous list that's we can find on Wikipedia that's men and that's One of the brothers is less than what's. &nbsp;Let's &nbsp;you can tell us what's wrong with it, what it, what is maybe let's back it up a bit.</p><p>So what is a brave brachial giant change principle. Yeah. So before I go out and it's why, or maybe, why. How, what Brian rationalized trashing the orthodoxy here. We're being a bit iconoclast. Cause I'm about to tear down. I don't think a lot of people hold to be true.</p><p>Yeah. That's a wonderful question. So what's it. Behavioral change principles. And so it's. It starts there. So a lot of people say, we take that giant wheel, that's been floating around with all these cognitive biases. And you pick one of them or you take any of Cialdini's behavior change principles, right?</p><p> You can ask someone why do you even believe that's true. Is it real? Is loss of version real? Is it true that in all situations that humans fear loss more than they desire a game is that in mathematically proven is the Principle of reciprocity is that, always true or not true.</p><p>And you can challenge these. Now, the problem is that once you get into behavioral science it's like entering a bureaucracy and the rules get more and more dense than the distinctions get deeper and deeper. And you go from a taxonomy of. Six behavior change principles. And now you're at 200 behavior change principles.</p><p>And when you get down to the 200 principles, it's Oh, this principle is a combination of that. And it's spun in this way. And &nbsp;so you start splitting hairs at some point. So where do these actual behavior change principles come from? And then let me answer that. And then we could go back to the giant shopping lists that people throw around is almost like magic solutions for how to change behavior.</p><p>Yeah. So yeah. And there's also, there's a little bit of politics in here as well. So maybe I could throw that in. So one of the requirements for getting a PhD and one of the requirements for surviving, something called publish or perish. Is recognition. So you have to be recognized for your work.</p><p>And so academics are under pressure to have a new discovery, right? &nbsp;Oh, I found a new behavior change principle. I found a new copy was bias. I, I found this, no one knew about it, but I found it. So the easy pickings are gone. So &nbsp;self-efficacy saying that was a. Self efficacy was not in a number of early behavior change models.</p><p>That was like later at it. And I think, and Asian later I added that when like his transition from theory of reason action to the plan behavior was actually, it was a patch up job, adding social norms at, I believe it was social norms and self-advocacy or I think, or maybe it was just self-efficacy that was added to the mix.</p><p>But basically it was like, Oh, Huh, I I forgot that principle and it proved to be good. So a new principal had come out of nowhere. Assuming it would be so highly correlated with behavioral outcomes that people are like, ah, crap. I got to add that in my model sucks. And I add that in and now we get better predictive.</p><p>Patterns on the effectiveness of our model. &nbsp;So there's this competition and there's new principals and stuff. So the principals have come from old. The original old principals you'll find in the work of Aristotle that are actually quite. Popular and the old works of rhetoric persuasion principles, and actually many of the cognitive biases you'll find in the ancient Greek writings on the informal fallacies.</p><p>So these are rational argumentation tactics that are their cognitive biases. So that means are ways of getting someone to change through consent. And intellectual type of misunderstanding, as opposed to say a social norm, that of way of getting someone to change, which will be through social, emotional pressure versus a, another type of mechanism that drives the behavior change principle.</p><p>So scientists. Have to come up with these psychological models. Now, most of the behavior change principles are psychological based. And &nbsp;maybe I could do something that Jordan Peterson did, if this is okay. Explains a factor analysis is this is not to like suicide. How do psychologists actually distill what an actual behavior change principle is?</p><p>Because not a lot of people even know where to. Yeah. So let me explain one thing tactical cause. I can call anything a behavior change principle, anything I like, like I could say, I don't know, making someone stare at you for five seconds causes them to like you, or if I touch someone, it will cost them to trust me a little bit more.</p><p>I can say anything. I like. But now I got to measure that. So a lot of the behavior change principles, we know, come from psychological models where April scientists might make a survey question and they will come up with different things that they call a construct. So say a social norm which is a popular one.</p><p>We all know. And trust in the source of a message might be another principal. And that you can name anyone and anticipation of the outcome could be, yet the third w we could just start inventing these. So I could build a statistical model. And then run it through something called factor analysis, and then correlate that to whether people did the behavior or not.</p><p>And then based on that, I'll start figuring out, Oh, are some of these principles correlated with behavioral outcomes or are they just different ways of saying the exact same thing? What factor analysis does, that's brilliant. Is it clusters similar things together? So what factor analysis does is it lets us cut through the nonsense.</p><p>So there were BA there are behavioral. Finally, there are behavioral economics researchers who have gone through and said, look, these shopping lists of a hundred principles is complete and utter nonsense. They get factor analysis. You know what their principal lists come out to. It's eight, eight, Yes.</p><p>Just &nbsp;you can write another book, you got to 6% plus one. So that's basically next the children's next book, and also depends on how you frame them. So if you frame the principles as broad things, factor analysis, we'll pull all the sub techniques into each other. Yeah, so you'll have the sub principles and that the hairsplitting tactics, and you need to know those, that's just part of getting better at and applied behavioral science, but the factor also show, you know what, they're just a variation of the same old. Thing at eight is not the actual number. I'd have to go back and look at the actual number from the paper, but it was, I think it was about somewhere in that number.</p><p>Also behavioral sciences in the UK. They reduced, I think about 120 behavioral science principles. And this was through consensus to around 20. And I think the factor analysis probably would have gone down even more. That sounds much more manageable, but also don't you. So don't you think it's also because of &nbsp;the people that then see those principles they issue, okay, this is a, this is what works and it works all the time.</p><p>You said, okay, this is a principle. I found this this is gonna uncle my work. Everywhere. And then we can apply it everywhere, but that's also an assumption that the person makes reading. That's not often necessarily what the researcher intended. They just did a research and usually. And from reading all those research papers, my experience is that's a word slightly better than B, but never never always or everywhere or that's and that's usually not the research research intention is.</p><p>But that's how it's popularized and then it gets into a list. Yeah. That's part of the absurd distortion that happens when knowledge goes from the scientific community into industry and between that are the gurus who discord, like that's where you BJ, Fogg. His work ultimately he finally published and actually I saw you just got, at least he's like New York time bestseller and like nothing like Amazon is doing very well but his work turned into something called tiny habits about very small changes.</p><p>But look how BJ Fogg's work got spun into absurd conspiracy theories called hooked. Like you can addict people. It's like the actual academic. Called it tiny gaskets, not hooked.</p><p>And then my doctorate, I spent two years looking at all the meta-analyses and the big reviews of these behavior change tools and behavior or something was so low on the list. It's a requirement as a minimum for communications, but its effects are very small. And so tiny habits got spun it to getting people hooked and addicted.</p><p>And then people believe this. And now a very small principle that came from a small area of research is something like you said, people now start applying it to. Everything as if it's going to have stellar effects across the board, wherever you go. And that is utter insanity, those AIDS or those 20 that they bolt, boil everything down to they still have their they apply in certain situations and not everywhere.</p><p>There's still not a universal apply them everywhere. Yeah. They're most of the behavioral science principles are context dependent and. What people also don't know is that when you actually you'll know this by a lot of people are more lay and practitioner level in the use of these principles.</p><p>They don't know is that in every scientific paper, there's something called the limitation section. And the limitation section actually says how generalizable that knowledge is. And what academics do is they limit the heck out of almost everything they write. They'll say that, this nudge strategy worked with middle age women in suburban Nebraska in December of this year.</p><p>And it's that's the population. And now you're like, you're going to get everyone hooked or something. And the distortions are incredible. But there are some principles that are more universal that do work time and time again. And the broad frameworks tend to latch in onto those very broad principles.</p><p>And I think those you'll mainly find explained by our cognitive processes and our emotional systems and some very &nbsp;rock hundred laying factors that drive human behavior. And those tend to be a bit more generalizable, but yeah, a lot of the principals get spun to the point of absurdity and I have to do, I have to deal with that in my training.</p><p>I have to do a lot of debunking and it's like the impact is the other area of distortion. So not only is it generalizable to all humans, right? But the, so a lot of these papers will say this only impact that this had like about normally a thought published as a percentage, but let's just call it a percentage because that's what many people understand, right?</p><p>So let's say this improved outcomes by 10% once people figure out the principle that improved outcomes by 10%. Once the gurus misinterpret the science and start misleading the public. What they're going to do is going to treat it as a hundred percent. I think it works all the time.</p><p>It's watch. I see that constantly. And then, and the people, and then something that was like a marginal improvement is now like a massive like transformative strategy. And you're like we're where did that come from? So that, so there, it's not just gender, there's a lot of distortion. It's not just the generalizability problem.</p><p>Yeah, I think that's a problem. A lot of Euro people encounter when they start their career or start at a new job. And if the three year old rule that's your old role at the company is fairly new than a lot of people. The people that hired you or the team you combine they, they have those assumptions, right?</p><p>They're there at the beginning and the Dunning-Kruger charts where they may have heard some of those. Principals and assume that, Oh these are all true. And that, that's something you need to in an internal battle that you might encounter say, okay, but it actually doesn't work like that.</p><p>Unfortunately there are a lot of ways it doesn't work. We don't know if it's gonna work on our sides and we need to do, basically, we need to do a lot of research and validation to figure it out what's actually works what works for us or not. Yeah. That's like a very good point. If, actually, if you're called, if you're a more deep into applying psychology and some of your colleagues are on board sometimes a little bit of knowledge is a bad thing, but I think normally most people it's not a problem at all.</p><p>And it's in fact that you would think because while you can often do say, okay, let's go with the social norm. I don't like using the word social proof and that's fine. You can use it. It's just my I'll call it a social norm because I actually did a study where we split different types of social influence but have been proven APAC behavior.</p><p>And we actually use we actually couldn't find social proof as a distinct principle, separate from a social norm. &nbsp;Did a statistical study in these public systems in the lip. But so in fact, social proof or social norms will have many sub-components. So underneath a social norm, that could be something called social facilitation, where you're making, letting people feel they're being watched by other people.</p><p>You can have social learning principles. Where you're educating people by having them watch other people do things. There's obviously the social norm itself and also within social norms, there's multiple sub categories of how you would implement the norm. And that's where the hairsplitting calls.</p><p>Cause you need to understand those. So what I sometimes would do with people is they say, okay, let's go with the social norm. W do we want to do it like this or that styles? Anyone want to do some research on different ways of implementing it? Because. People might not know the names for all the different types of social psych principles and social influence principles, but as they play with different tactics that work they'll actually be playing on actually sometimes very different principles of social influence, thinking that they're implementing a social norm or social proof, but they're actually implementing a completely different.</p><p>Social, psychological principle and I'm okay. Cause you could do well with tactics. Just as long as they're open and they're testing, I figure that the testing will point you in the right direction. &nbsp;Your users will pretty much tell you. &nbsp;I will get blue in my face Oh, that's, you're using this principle.</p><p>Not that I could let it go. And then any of the worst case scenario, sometimes for diplomatic reasons, I will accept a something that I'm really against. And I'll say. If you're really morally against it, sometimes you have to say, I'm a Gates. This I am not accountable. If you want to go forward, I'll give you all the glory.</p><p>That's like really bad. That's a total conflict. And it very rarely happens a few times in my career. It's come to that. But normally it's okay let's just task it. And maybe I'm wrong as well because could, I'm a big. I miss God this expert in my area.</p><p>If I make mistakes all the time. And like the users are the ultimate judge, so I'll let them overrule my judgment any day. So when you, when do you know went to when you're applying, if you're applying the right principle and if you're applying the rights strategy for the challenges.</p><p>Yeah. That's a great question. Maybe I could talk about a collaboration I did with a good friend of mine. Michael Lee. Who's a he's a fairly prominent conversion optimization specialist. He's a huge Daniel Conaman fan. And we met like many years ago and we've been good friends ever since. He asked her, I'm just saying, yeah, we did a course in conversion XL together.</p><p>We talked about doing a course and then pep approached me. And then I wrote to my say, Hey, remember we said to a course, do you want to collaborate? And then, so we did a great course, but. And maybe one last thing. &nbsp;Knew we were destined to be good friends because he had a tattoo on his arm that said, Hey, Oh, I think it's, Hey, ho let's go.</p><p>And I bought, he served for the Ramones when I was younger. We're all good funding. Nice. Yeah. So you guys worked together on the core four for CXL you a more afforded from the theoretical background and Michael, more from the practical. Let's run a lot of tests background.</p><p>That's exactly it. So I, and so I wanted to, maybe I'll tell you this story cause there's two ways of approaching it. So how do you know what is the right principle for the job? So what's awesome about Michael is, he's spent 10 years split testing before he got into psychology at all.</p><p>Everything he knew was it's amazing. It's from brute force and Michael is incredibly it's uncanny how he has such a natural sense for what works. And that's, so he's got hyper tactical knowledge and he told me like, at one point he's I just know, you'd have to put all these trusts things next to the button.</p><p>I don't know why, and I know that you have to color it like this. And it was very, yeah, it's like this incredible tactical knowledge. So he could tell you where you put every UI element on the page to get better conversion. And after 10 years of split testing, he got incredibly good at that. No. I came at things a little differently.</p><p>I started hands-on so I was building and I always worked in Metro mate, but I was not a early adopter of AB testing tools. I think I started on those a few years in after they were exploding. So even before people use the word CRO think or. I was there just when it was taking off but they're true.</p><p>CRO experts. I don't even think CR like CRO is not really a thing for many years. Just like UX, wasn't even a thing, attractive design. Wasn't a thing. Digital, like all the professions we have. We were using for well over a decade before they even had formal lakes. So I &nbsp;is also basically doing user research, using qualitative and quantitative data, combining that and doing validation.</p><p>So in that sense, it's existed for a very long time, but somehow Ciera was very much linked to doing it on a website. Of course. But those principles are. Yeah. Yeah. They've been around for so long. And so Michael went on a tactically and me, I went through I always did a lot of measurement and hands-on work.</p><p>But I, I went deep into it. I was just like a PhD. And then my PhD, I was analyzing, the principles that are used in behavior change, taxonomies, and used in technology. So after several years, I could look at any page and tell you the main principles that are being applied and that can generally guess.</p><p>How well a product was doing because, and this was way before anyone was doing any work in psychology. So when I started, most people thought I was insane for looking at psychology on the web. So who would do that? That's stupid. But so I had this incredible knowledge. That's right gears analyzing the psychological principles I've published in the scientific literature and like some prominent health behavior change journals did a full statistical meta analysis.</p><p>It was like pretty solid on full tactical now. So I could look at something and approach it from a theoretical and framework perspective. Michael could approach it from a tactical spread perspective, &nbsp;we're not that radical because obviously I do a lot of measurement and I also.</p><p>Would know things based on, what works in practical applications and seeing impact metrics. So it's not like I'm a pure ivory tower, academic and Michael got into psychology later on and he started up think consuming everything with an incredible appetite. And he became a very deep expert in to Daniel economists' approach.</p><p>And. Content for behavioral economics, which I could say Michael probably knows behavioral economics principles deeper than anyone. I know, like he so we both came at it, but we have these strengths and I think we recognize them. We're also musicians, so we never did a gig together, but I think we would probably perform well on stage.</p><p>So there's two ways to approach it. What is the right principle for a job? So this comes down to something called fit and you might know it from having a lot of tactical knowledge. So that tactical knowledge, if you've worked in the industry or in an area, and you've been working with clients and customers for many years, you will tend to know what works just from brute force, trial and error.</p><p>You'll eventually figure it out. Basically you succeed or you fail. And if you're still standing, you're doing something, so you. You figured it out through brute force and you know what works now, the problem with that knowledge is it normally doesn't translate well. So you can't go to a neighboring application.</p><p>So say someone who's optimizing insurance landing pages, &nbsp;can they now go to a nonprofit and optimize the donation page? Probably not, or, a lot of things will carry over, but there's a lot of tactical things so will work. And now let's look at things from a purely theoretical perspective.</p><p>So I have these very broad frameworks and I could look at almost anything in any industry. And I could pretty much guess, okay, they're using this. I see how they're tied up. I could go into the industry and I could see, okay, most people in this industry are making this and that I could rattle off almost instantly all the general principles.</p><p>And I could reverse engineer the psychological strategies used by your tire industries insanely fast. Cause that's what I specialize in. That's just my shtick. I spent a lot of time doing it. And so between the two, you can get a sense of what works, and figuring out the, what is the right principle for any challenge and context is something you would call fit.</p><p>So what's the right fitting principle and you build that up through years of experience. So unfortunately there is not an off the shelf answer to that. So years of experience will help you to understand that the. Stopping with the mindless application of behavioral science principles is a good way to get better at it.</p><p>And going with what is the behavioral science framework that's most appropriate to mind work? No, that means you'll have to get into theory. And a lot of people don't like that. They love their magic shopping list of the 10 psychological principles that will hook your right and all that nonsense there.</p><p>They. So it will require an investment. And I, I try and help my students. I give them the frameworks and I help them create the judgment. Some people don't want that. I know they want the magic solution that works a hundred percent in all situations for all humans. Unfortunately it doesn't.</p><p>Does it work? I don't if you could give it to me. Yeah. I'll take it. So it comes down to like playing with the models. Reverse engineering and industry is a good start. &nbsp;You could use some sneaky tools, use some spite technology. I don't know, use like SpyFu or SEM, rush, try and figure out who's spending money and where the competition is and where there's landing pages.</p><p>You might not know the conversion metrics, right? You could use some scouting tools, try and find the landing pages in the industry where, there's something going on. That the needle is tipping and that there's something in there. You do a review of those. Don't steal a single idea cause that's theft, but figure out the principles and then go back to the drawing board and use that to do things in a way based on your own user research but never, ever copy principles.</p><p>Verbatim because what works in one context can fail in another. So it's insanely dangerous. And my also advice is never steal tactics because tactics are very dangerous. Like I see when I worked on the agency side, when I worked on the agency side it's when something worked at the one client, we often tried copying that over to other clients.</p><p>It usually didn't work well. Yeah, you can get backfires very easily from that. Yep. Yep. Hey so w when you ditch, obviously, so when you get a fresh batch, a batch of students, one of the most common. I guess misconceptions or the most prevalent misconceptions that you need to restart the bunking right away.</p><p>Oh yeah, there's a few. So one thing I now do more and more of is I tell people, look. Applied behavioral science is a research heavy process, right? So that means, there's a lot to learn. And it is, and we're going to implement it in a very user centered and user driven approach.</p><p>So I try and back up I, every guru and expert will tell you, satisfy your users. . Standard. So I try and set the expectation that look I'm not going to give you a magic set of principles that work in all cases. Another, so another misconception is that there are these magic shopping lists of what works in all cases for all people.</p><p>And it's so I try and set the expectation that it requires a bit more of a flexible approach and requires you to shop around. One thing that I deal with, so I I train everywhere, went from people who are absolute beginners to world elite designers. And also I train a lot of behavioral science and behavioral science teams, just because for a behavioral science team, I'll be T P I'll be teaching my peers, but they recognize I'm their peer who specialized in digital.</p><p>And so I have. A very deep knowledge only, in my niece. And I'll even tell those some of the more experienced people said, I need to tell you a lot of things you already know, but I'm just going to show you how they apply, in, in a medium that you haven't worked in. And that's important because there's no guarantee.</p><p>So one is that. It's setting that expectation that you're going to have to put in some effort to learn things. And there's maybe. I actually, there's one maybe other thing. And it's something that's changed in me quite a lot. And that's yeah, we were talking about behavior change principles.</p><p> Ended up segmenting my course into behavioral science and neuroscience. I called my second course emotional design, but that's. It's the it's neuroscience at because decisive emotions is neuroscience, right? It's neuroscience gives us more understanding of emotions than psychology does.</p><p>And I know that might sound funny to people, but you're all science through you actually. Chop open the nervous system and you take a look at what's going on a bit more literally. And so we have a better understanding of emotion. So it's &nbsp;don't do this at home, by the way. Don't shop junk, shop over here and ever assistant under that.</p><p>What kind of, if you have, neurotech like here I have my my visual cortex and other things, but yeah. But otherwise don't talk, open your brain and measure your emotions. Yeah, actually, why gets taking your policies that easy way to do it? But the other thing is to set the expectations that emotion-based design and more and applied psychology or behavioral science is more dogmatic.</p><p>So I try to tell people it's actually behavioral science is really easy. It's more like just. Learning a bunch of principles that fit into these models and then shopping around for the best fitting one. And then it's actually a fun and creative act. And that's the other thing, because I also, I did improv for a little bit of time and people don't realize how fun it is to apply behavioral sites. And I train all these, sorry. Earlier I mentioned, I trained people from beginners to like elite designers. I also train public health officials and then prominent behavioral scientists and public health. And they're shocked. These people have been wounded by very stiff 500 page of behavior change books.</p><p>And I show them how to pick the principles and models. But then what I do next is the crazy thing that no one, most people don't even know about. We played game of improv at that point and we have fun and we do a creative process and that the science and creativity go so well together. And th I don't just say this dogmatically people crack up laughing in my class.</p><p>We have so much fun. These are the best moments when we do that handover from the card analysis and research, and then we're getting creative if you do it right. It's awesome. So that's the expectation that has to be cracked. It's not stiff. It's fun. Definitely something that's heroes can copy.</p><p>I think I set the expectations right. When you're starting to have fun. Let's do that. Let's do that. Brian final question for you. When you look at, &nbsp;yeah. When you look at the profession, the people working in that compared with what you do, what's the insight that you have that you think that Shiraz haven't.</p><p>Got up on yet. So what should they invest more time in, but yeah what the heart of everything I do and let's just keep going more and more is going back to actually one of Aristotle's principles. And, &nbsp;the whole concept of humans are driven by their intellect, emotion and lizard brain.</p><p>So there's something more to that. So that's actually just say that's similar to Aristotle's concept that you appeal to the intellect to the emotions, but then it's the credibility of the speaker. And so I think forming trust with the brand is important. So what a lot of people don't know is that humans interact with brands similar to how they interact with other humans.</p><p>And I know that might sound insane. There are now studies that show you can manipulate Rand. &nbsp;An interpretation of a brand and your emotional connection with a brand, with a couple of spritzers of oxytocin spray up the nose. And that social cognition, which is manipulated through a couple of oxytocin's fruits is also impacts on user brand relationships.</p><p> In that having an emotional connection. With an authentic credible source behind the message is the main thing. So it's like authenticity and I can't give any more advice on how to establish credibility than this. Be credible, know your, know, your stuff and act in the interest of people and be authentic.</p><p>And I believe that will carry through and the rest. We're just thrown on top of that. And here's the other thing from all the studies I do. If you violate that credibility, this is what happens. You could do your own testing. I see it every time I test this people, a well-designed website that fails the credibility and trust test.</p><p>Can instantly evoke fear and anxiety and distrust. That is like fatal flaw. So be authentic as it's made the Brian, thank you so much for for your time and sharing all of this with us. What are you working on the next this year of 2021. Yeah. &nbsp;Am actually in a. Retreat mode.</p><p>So while COVID is still going on I set myself a bunch of goals. So I actually I pursued too many things at once, so I'm not, I have a line. So first I'm cleaning up my school. So I've been working, hands-on implementing funnels. Do I? I actually, I decided I'm going to rebuild it all myself. I have contractors that work.</p><p>With me and it's a mess. So I, so the only way, got to bite the bullet and then I improve all of my technical skills. So that keeps me current. So I'm on that. I know finally writing a book on everything. So my entire training system, I'm putting into a book on everything. Yeah. I feel, I just want to get it out of the way.</p><p>And then and then next I have a whole personality system which I use as the basis for making predictions on principles to use with different people. So it's a behavioral personality system designed to measure people's neural transmitters and hormone levels, and that to correlate with the taxonomy of behavior change that I use.</p><p>And I'm using that for AI. Technology. And if that's not enough, I started teaching myself C plus I put this one down. It's what I'm really passionate about. What I really want to do. I don't think I'll have any time for this, but I'm very interested in mind links. Neurotech and how we design how are we designed for human conscious perception of spatial relationships and sound and tactile experience?</p><p>So going into the user experience, but in a way where I can transmit my experiences to another person. I'm so interested in brain link technology, which is why I happen to have a visual cortex reader with, and this is just part of it. I have a whole suite, I put it down like, Brian, stop this you're insane.</p><p>You're too distracted focus. So that's what I'm passionate about going to, I get that. I get like video games. I'll get off that dopamine kick for now. Yeah. So let me know and know when the book is done, then we can do a podcast on that. And after death, we can do another podcast on the Neuralink.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>From a question who should I ask to come on the podcast? Oh yeah. So I I just had a couple of friends who are an orchid and the people. So my friend Agnes quite did some studies with he's a good person to speak with. And he's now a professor in Paris. He did his doctoral research on social psych and I did a study with him.</p><p>So he's good to speak with if, say you want to go to the New York, the nuance of just social psychology. And how it operates in technical environments. And he could give you a ton of examples on the basically, if you want to say, okay, social proof is a broad concept. But it's, if you want to go a level down into all the social influence that is correlated with it it's going to be social norm, but here are all the other highly correlated social site principles.</p><p>So you go to that one other person, David shadows is a. A friend and a professor in gamification and education. So he could talk about gamification designs, but it for engagement this stuff a lot of it is stuff you could probably talk about LMS as it might be outside of conversion design.</p><p>And, Agnes has work is going to be way more of this also social change. So when you get to the academics, they tend to get a bit off page and more into the broader campaign. Yeah, but like you said, it makes sense to have a theoretical understanding of what you're dealing with.</p><p>And I can get a sense of where this, where are these theories actually coming from our, and to be critical about them. Yeah, Brian, thank you so much. We're way past our time. Thank you so much for for educating us and sharing all your experience with with us and definitely looking forward to that book.</p><p>And yeah, said let me know when it comes out and then we can promote it under our audience. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Have a great day. Bye-bye.</p><p>‍</p>",false,

And first of course, we'd like to know a bit more about you. , &nbsp;could you enlighten us to start with, why are you still working in Sierra? </p><p>Merritt: [00:01:11] Yeah. And that's the keyword there is still right? Because it's been about 10 years for me. No , &nbsp;I think I go back to when I got into CRO and , &nbsp;I stumbled my way into it actually when I was in college doing a graduate degree.</p><p>But what I immediately loved about it was , &nbsp;the breadth of demand of skills that. Went into CRO, right? There's the analysis part of things. There's the technical part of things and the coding, there's the statistics part of things. There's the creativity part of things. And what you're presenting to people and how you're solving problems.</p><p>And , &nbsp;and there's the visual and design part of things. And then all of that gets. , &nbsp;the method by which that happens is you have to be good at project management and sort of business skills. And , &nbsp;not only is all of that relevant to CRO, but it rewards you if you're good at, it has some breadth and all of those things.</p><p>I've always been a little bit of a Jack of all trades. I don't have formal training any of those things, but I have a lot of interest in all of them. </p><p>Guido: [00:02:12] Many people calling themselves Ciro specialists, it should be Ciro generally. </p><p>Merritt: [00:02:16] Pretty much. Yeah. Yeah, I'd make a terrible , &nbsp;statistician, a terrible developer, a terrible designer , &nbsp;and probably a terrible general business person.</p><p>But you put all those things together and I've got, I'm just dangerous enough in all of them to be decent at my job. </p><p>Guido: [00:02:33] Yeah. And &nbsp;, &nbsp;you're still working in it. So do you expect in 10 years we will have the same conversation you're still working in zero. Do you think things have changed? Not necessarily for you personally, but in the field, what zero means.</p><p>Merritt: [00:02:45] I don't know. I think they may kick me out by then. What I just said about the, what makes the field really interesting to me and like the diversity of skills and challenges, those challenges continue, but I honestly think it'd be hard for someone to follow that pathway today and be a generalist.</p><p>I think as , &nbsp;I think as experimentation becomes a bigger part of the DNA of organizations that. It will require more specialization. Cause more people will have the general knowledge of how to do things and you'll just need people who are really good at one particular thing. That's my, if I look , &nbsp;into the future, that's what I'm seeing.</p><p>Guido: [00:03:17] Yeah, exactly. And to give people some context , &nbsp;your optimization, directorates , &nbsp;search decor discovery , &nbsp;what do you do? </p><p>Merritt: [00:03:25] That's a great question. </p><p>Guido: [00:03:28] I wish I could say, what do you say at parties when people ask you what you do when you have a family reunion? </p><p>Merritt: [00:03:34] Yeah, actually one of my favorite things to ask , &nbsp;my family is what do you guys think I do for a living and get all sorts of answers from, , &nbsp;Make stuff online, design people think I design websites.</p><p>I don't design websites. No , &nbsp;I tell people that I run experiments on people who don't know they're getting experiments, run on them , &nbsp;on the internet when they visit websites and applications. On a day-to-day basis, my job is working with clients. Mainly to set up and operate optimization programs.</p><p>So that sometimes that involves executing experiments, not nearly as much as I would like. Cause I think that's the really fun part of the job. A lot of the times it's just &nbsp;working with organizations to figure out how to. Set up the capability inside their , &nbsp;their organization. Sometimes it's just troubleshooting or support in some ways or office hours.</p><p>But there's a little bit of everything. No, no day, no two days are the same. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:04:27] And one of the things you've been working on lately is building an, a, an AB desk calculator. Please tell us why we should be using yours and also all the others. The only one with an AB Tesco clutter. Let's be fair.</p><p>So why did you feel this urge to build </p><p>Merritt: [00:04:41] your own? Yeah, and to be honest, I don't care if you use mine.</p><p>I'm pretty darn sure. I'm the number one user of my own calculator here. &nbsp;You can, I can tell you who I built it for. No, I, I've been using calculators that have been free and available online for years. And I rely on them to do my job effectively and , &nbsp;there are some great.</p><p>There's resources out there. And and the list of resources only grows. So I'm not trying to do all and be all to , &nbsp;to everyone's needs, but I will say, sequential testing, I don't know how deeply you want to get into this, but , &nbsp;it was something that I actually just started out wanting to understand at a deeper level.</p><p>Right to get the statistics a little bit better. I've used a number of calculators out there. I was, I had front row seat to an optimized. You went to a sequential stats engine is , &nbsp;is how they framed it. I've been a user of the analytics, toolkit , &nbsp;dot com resources and the agile calculator that you got to be built there.</p><p>I've used Evan Miller's sequential. Yep. Simple sequential calculator, all of those, I wanted to understand a little more and I wanted to be able to self-serve. So I got into this and, I think to my knowledge, this is the only one that , &nbsp;that is free and could be called robust out there today.</p><p>, &nbsp;I'm sure that won't last for long, but , &nbsp;but right now I think it's a unique resource in, in, like I said, I use it all the time, </p><p>Guido: [00:06:11] for those that are not familiar, what is specific about sequential IBD? </p><p>Merritt: [00:06:17] So if you're anything like me, at some point you heard you can't peek on your tests and.</p><p>That was a revelation to me the first time I heard it, because I was speaking on my tests because the testing tools, they encouraged us to do it right. Even today, like some of the biggest testing tools out there are showing you stats that aren't valid. Because they're showing you they're there, they're running the test constantly.</p><p>Every time you look at it , &nbsp;And so that's peaking. That's not how , &nbsp;how , &nbsp;fixed horizon testing works, which is the breed of testing that most of us use , &nbsp;the alternative to that would be Beijing testing. But , &nbsp;I don't have the wits to go down that road and neither do I have the, the stamina for it today.</p><p>But &nbsp;in the testing that most of our used to you. Create a sample size, a plan, and you're supposed to stick to that sample size. You're supposed to not look at the results , &nbsp;at least not calculate a statistical , &nbsp;result until you collect the full sample size. So by Peking you increase your error rate, your type one error rate.</p><p>And that's a problem. And even peaking every 10% of your sample size , &nbsp;you may go from like a 90%, sorry, a 10% , &nbsp;type one error rate to a 30% type one area over the course of your test. And that's what the, a flat result. , &nbsp;yeah, so peaking is bad. And sequential testing basically allows you to peak responsibly.</p><p>It allows you to guarantee that you maintain that type one error rate as you go through a test and , &nbsp;and look at the results. And I like to say that like it's useful, peaking is useful in the face of extreme results. MDE, minimum detectable effect. Minimum effective interests, whatever that is the.</p><p>Thing we don't know much about before we ran the test, </p><p>Guido: [00:08:08] but what your needs to calculate your sample size? Yes. </p><p>Merritt: [00:08:12] There's this whole test design around this thing that we know. So little about that there's one thing we learned in testing it's that we have no freaking clue what the outcome of subpoena is going to be.</p><p>We don't know if it's gonna be good or bad or really good, or the most surprising results. Where is we're testing becomes most valuable. So yeah. So acknowledging that's like the hardest thing to predict and then giving yourself a tool to run an efficient test, regardless of what that thing is, what that impact is.</p><p>That's a, that's why sequential testing is really valuable. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:08:43] Yeah, I had the exact same , &nbsp;exact case today actually. &nbsp;We're , &nbsp;they wanted to test , &nbsp;three or four variants &nbsp;of a promotion on the websites. And normally when you see promotions on the website, their default was okay, you can get , &nbsp;this amount of discounts.</p><p>But only when you order this from this amount, like you can get the 25% discount, but only if you order. 50 years or over a 100 euros. And that's the default. And , &nbsp;one of the tests, one of the variants was okay, you get this discount period without any requirements of minimum order value. And , &nbsp;the team, the local teams, , &nbsp;this is very risky.</p><p>We can do the test beds. Maybe let's do it only at the 1% of the , &nbsp;number of visitors. Of course, I'm like, okay. But then the test is gonna run forever. We don't have the sample size to pull that off, so we need to do it, , &nbsp;equal split. But then there, they come with requirements say, okay, but then we need to have some stopping measures in place.</p><p>, &nbsp;we want to run this for four weeks, but after one week we already find out, okay, this is going very extremely in a negative way. We need to be able to stop this. This is a perfect case for sequential testing. I think so. How would you go about, &nbsp;federating this and then testing if it's big enough, </p><p>Merritt: [00:09:57] That's, that is exactly one of the key use cases for sequential testing.</p><p>And I didn't mention this, but </p><p>Guido: [00:10:03] I don't mind personally, I would just let test go for four weeks and then see what happens. But BIS business teams, my, my thing differently. </p><p>Merritt: [00:10:12] Yeah. And w one thing I see a lot is , &nbsp;people checking in on a test early on, right? Like you're a couple, two, 5% into the sample and you're.</p><p>Checking to see if anything catastrophic is happening. A lot of times, I don't see people having a good framework for saying, okay, what is catastrophic in this case? Is this decline that I'm seeing is this significant enough to be concerned about? And the other thing you get out of sequential testing is a rubric by which to measure a decline early on.</p><p>, &nbsp;and to determine if that's yeah, a statistically significant decline or not, right? Like one of the concepts in. And at least in my sequential calculator and many others is a futility boundary. Should you give up early? And yeah. So in, in your case or in many others, right? Being able to say, okay, we're, we'll plan the test.</p><p>This is the maximum duration of the test, but we're going to check in on an early on 5% just to see if there's anything really extreme going on and the results. And. Hopefully you're using something like the decision plan upfront, where you can say, if we cross this boundary, then we're going to pull the plug or we're going to, , &nbsp;that's what we'll call a significant decline.</p><p>Otherwise we're going to keep going. Even if it's down 5%, if that's not past our futility boundary, we're going to stick with it. </p><p>Guido: [00:11:30] Yeah. And I can imagine that it's quite difficult to include such a boundary in your calculations because it can be different for each test, right? It's going to be , &nbsp;of course it can be revenue based.</p><p>If you go down 5%, then that's a, the boundary. But maybe my experiment is not about revenue at all. Maybe it's about newsletter subscribers, and you might be okay. We're not necessarily losing money. So it's fine if it goes down 10%. </p><p>Merritt: [00:11:54] So that's a, that's actually a really good point. There is a.</p><p>There, there are many different ways to do sequential testing. And if you start reading the literature on it , &nbsp;it, it becomes a little overwhelming because I don't know, like all stats, literature, there's like all these names that could poke cock, Brian Fleming and I can't even pronounce some of the names cause they're very foreign to me, but &nbsp;all these people have come up with different methods of approaching sequential testing.</p><p>Some of them are conservative than others. And that those who are providing calculators have actually made some decisions about how conservative those methods are going to be. I actually hope to, at some point, allow someone to shift those parameters a little bit, to take something that's more conservative or less conservative in terms of their approach to the decision boundaries.</p><p>As of right now, it's fixed. I had. I have been pretty transparent about like how those parameters are set. Th those are fairly technical details in the test design, but it's good. It's good for us to know out that there are. Just like when you're designing the test and you're saying, okay, what's my con, what constant competence do I need?</p><p>What power do I need? And what's my NDE. That there's a lot, there are a lot more parameters to your tests that you can configure to say, this is how aggressive my decision boundary needs to be. And usually it ends up affecting the shape of it. And I realize we're talking about this kind of abstractly , &nbsp;what are these decision boundaries and could point to it, but , &nbsp;But, yeah, it's like you said , &nbsp;you do need a pretty diverse , &nbsp;toolkit to approach these things because the problems are different and your risk levels are gonna be different.</p><p> </p><p>Guido: [00:13:26] , &nbsp;for people to need , &nbsp;specifically your , &nbsp;sequential tests, , &nbsp;go Clara , &nbsp;what kind of data do they need to have? , &nbsp;as input, </p><p>Merritt: [00:13:32] there's only one thing you need to prepare. That's. In excess of what you normally need for just a normal fixed horizon test. And that is you need to plan out the number of , &nbsp;of check-ins or the number of analyses that you're going to do on the data.</p><p>, &nbsp;I usually plan something that's check in like once or twice on the data. And. Yeah. Usually the reason you're doing a sequential test is because , &nbsp;you're looking at a pretty long test horizon, like something like three, four, five, six weeks or whatever. And so sequential tests can help you get to that trend answer more efficiently.</p><p>But yeah. , &nbsp;other than that , &nbsp;it's your alpha, which is one minus your competence level. It's your beta, which is one minus your power or vice versa. However you want to look at those. It's your base conversion rates. The base rate that you're building off of , &nbsp;or your mean, if it's a continuous metric, by the way, my calculator does not yet support continuous metrics.</p><p>Yep. We'll get to it eventually. But yeah, base rates, you need the minimum detectable effect or a minimum effect of interest or effect size, or however you want to title that one. And your tails and &nbsp;, &nbsp;you actually get a fairly different test design. If you select two tail versus one tail , &nbsp;I know that's probably a topic we could chat with</p><p>But yeah, normally I go one tail, if it's too detailed, the boundaries look a little bit different, but , &nbsp;beyond that there are some optional inputs, right? Like you can, we have a support to put in your current traffic size. For your test area, like how much traffic you get in a week, a month or whatever.</p><p>And then you can estimate how many days it's going to take you. Just some , &nbsp;it's just a utility function in that you don't, it's not necessary, but it's helpful. </p><p>Guido: [00:15:10] Yeah. And this is bottom. So can you explain to us, why does it matter how often I pick, my test is going to run for four weeks.</p><p>How often I pick is not going to change the results. So Y is it, does it matter for the calculations for the, , &nbsp;afforded calculator that I predetermine the house. </p><p>Merritt: [00:15:30] So I will tell you right now, I'm going to fail at explaining this easily. This is one of those things that like, If you don't get it, it's really hard to understand an abstract.</p><p>And then once you get it , &nbsp;you instantaneously lose the ability to communicate that effectively to someone who doesn't it's just give it a shot. So there's actually a there's in, in basic probability that you learn, there's the probability of a thing happening? Let's say probably if you gain a heads, if you flip a coin, 50%, if it's an unweighted point. Okay. But what's the probability of you hitting a heads. If you flip a coin twice. I should know this off hand, but really simple calculation, , &nbsp;for doing that. It's it's , &nbsp;it compounds the probability of you getting the head aheads compounds. And it's the same thing in testing, right?</p><p>The probability of you getting a false positive, the first time you check on your data. Is with what, at whatever competence level you're setting for your test. And that's actually interesting to know, because a lot of us think like , &nbsp;you have to wait until the end of the test to check your data before you can assure your false positive rate, or just sure that you have the right competence level, but that's not true.</p><p>You can have , &nbsp;you can look at data after you've collected 50 samples and run a T test on it. And if it says that, you're 90% confident you can be 95, 90% confident that you're, you don't have a false negative or false positive there. So that doesn't change. However, if you run that test in and then run that test in a week, you've just increased your odds of having a false positive, just like you flipping a coin twice.</p><p>And your odds of getting ahead have , &nbsp;have increased. And so every time, every success of time that you run the test, and I realize like , &nbsp;we're mincing words a little bit like running the test. Can you consider collecting your full sample size, but running the test is also, it's just calculating the test statistic, the Z score, the, whatever your test statistic is.</p><p>So every time you calculate that test statistic, You are giving yourself another chance at a , &nbsp;a false outcome. Terrible job explaining that. </p><p>Guido: [00:17:50] You're gonna fact </p><p>Merritt: [00:17:50] check this afterwards, right? </p><p>Guido: [00:17:54] We'll put it in the show notes. The actual description. Yeah. That's w where's it's often , &nbsp;even when people know this is where it goes wrong.</p><p>Merritt: [00:18:03] I think I, I can't say that people make a ton of bad decisions, but I can say that they're not control. They're not controlling their errors. They don't know which decisions are bad. The fact that their error rates to begin with guarantees that we're going to make bad decisions at some point.</p><p>It's the question of the rate of bad decisions that you're making, or, , &nbsp;the rate of your ignorance in your decision-making and it goes to an unquantifiable and unquantified amount. </p><p>Guido: [00:18:33] Yeah. Basically you need to determine how comfortable are you with being wrong. Yeah. </p><p>Merritt: [00:18:39] Yeah. And if you're peaking, if you're not using this sequential method and not doing something to control your errors, you're just not quantifying that.</p><p>Precision in your decision-making. , &nbsp;so I would say that the biggest issue that you'll find is that people in making decisions early well, for one they're going to favor like , &nbsp;I guess this is true in all sequential testing, but you're favoring large effects and you're probably inflating, like you're biasing your effect, sizes upwards.</p><p>And so where you may have a confidence interval of this could be a change from between 1% to 30%. There you're mid rate. Your mean change is probably going to be higher. And it actually is on average. If you were to say like I'm taking 20 winners and the average effect size in these winners was 10%.</p><p>If you've been using a sequential method, you've probably biased that upwards and it's actually much lower than that. , &nbsp;that's going to be the case, whether you're using sequential method or not, if you're peaking, you're going to be responding to a higher effect sizes than actually exist.</p><p>Okay. </p><p>Guido: [00:19:43] Are there scenarios where you will, you would still say, please don't use sequential testing. Just let the test run anyway. </p><p>Merritt: [00:19:50] Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:19:53] One example , &nbsp;maybe I'm wrong with it. If there's, , &nbsp;some kind of a cycle, if you , &nbsp;if you, if there's some cyclic data in your , &nbsp;in the behavior of your, or your clients , &nbsp;I can imagine that might make sense where you were to expect, for example, different behavior in the first two weeks versus the second two weeks or </p><p>something.</p><p>Merritt: [00:20:11] Yeah, I think absolutely. That's a consideration that you've got to, you've got to put the lens of like business cycles and seasonality and stuff over your data. That's not necessarily a reason in my view to not do sequential testing because, just because , &nbsp;those cycles exist doesn't mean you want to ignore a really negative result, for example, like I think even if you have tons of traffic, And, reaching sample size in a reasonable amount of time is not an issue.</p><p>And in fact, you're like testing on smaller , &nbsp;on smaller subsets of the data because you have so much traffic and you want to be able to run a test for a week because, , &nbsp;I do typically recommend people run a test for at least a week. Now, maybe even two weeks is probably preferable. So you get a couple of those at least short business cycles in.</p><p>But you still want to, you still want to make &nbsp;things can tank and do really poorly. And that could be evident early on. And so having again, having this statistical calculation that you can make early on in the test is still valuable, but you're right. If you haven't run a test for a week, you should think twice about ending the test early on a negative result.</p><p>Because you may not have seen , &nbsp;a good cross section of your users. You may not have, you're never going to have a sample of future users, right? Every time we sample users, we're assuming that it represents. All users today and all users tomorrow. But you do want to make an effort and that's why, and that's why we'll try to run through a business cycle or two to try to get a more representative sample.</p><p>Guido: [00:21:43] Yeah. And, , &nbsp;your ranch, you already mentioned that we can discuss for hours, , &nbsp;in the comments on , &nbsp;on the one till first hotels. And then of course we have maybe even bigger free consist versus Beijing. ,</p><p>Merritt: [00:21:56] No, it doesn't only work. In fact. So I use an R package , &nbsp;To, to make the application work, that sequential calculator work and that our package actually supports the basion testing. , &nbsp;we're gonna hit real fast, like the limits of my expertise with, </p><p>Guido: [00:22:16] because </p><p>Merritt: [00:22:17] I have a. I have a couple of books on patient stats and, as hard as it is to read a stats book to begin with.</p><p>Guido: [00:22:24] No, yeah, I did want to go into Beijing versus first. I just want </p><p>Merritt: [00:22:28] to know </p><p>Guido: [00:22:28] is it's sequential testing , &nbsp;purely something that's limited to people doing frequent this , &nbsp;experiments or , &nbsp;going, can we both benefit? </p><p>Merritt: [00:22:35] Yeah, no. Th they, they do apply to Basian stats. And there is support again in the art package that I use for it.</p><p>I don't grok it as well. And I also know that, there's a lot of hard feelings is maybe the wrong answer, but there's a lot of criticism about Bayesian stats, , &nbsp;in the way they present the statistics and the way they make , &nbsp;make. Knowing the assumptions that are going into those stats.</p><p>And so I, people will say that Bayesian stats are immune to peaking and that's maybe glossy over some of the details a little bit. It's not completely true. You still do need to worry about , &nbsp;type one error rates. They, Asians , &nbsp;statisticians will say or people who are appropriate.</p><p>Beijing, they'll say like the probability, the test stat is valid all the time. Like it's always, whereas in frequented stats that P value does not always tell the truth. Yeah, they'll say that the stat you get from Asian is always , &nbsp;is always true, is always &nbsp;and again, I think that Pat, that glosses over some of the , &nbsp;the detail and the assumptions that are being made in busy patient sets.</p><p>So yeah, </p><p>Guido: [00:23:44] to me, it feels like a sequential testing is a good mix , &nbsp;between. Wanted to be the more rigorous methods, which is frequent in my view, the more rigorous method, also something I grew up with, and this is what we use. It mainly it's a universities when they ran experiments. But also you want to.</p><p>You want it to make the all pros to make businesses, right? We're not applying this to , &nbsp;to just do science and figure out exactly what's happening. You also want to make business decisions here. And , &nbsp;this is a good way to , &nbsp;at least capture , &nbsp;those moments where things can go wrong. And, , &nbsp;quickly, if you're not careful, and then you're actually losing a lot </p><p>Merritt: [00:24:22] of money.</p><p>Yeah, I'm with you on that. And it's funny to say like sequential testing is a way to get some of those , &nbsp;the benefits that people tout from Basian testing, but to do it in like the language and the format that you're used to, it's like the stats you grew up with, it's assessing learning </p><p>Guido: [00:24:40] college.</p><p>Merritt: [00:24:42] And that's a funny way to look at why people do it. Maybe there's just a bunch of inertia behind it. But I think I'm with you on that. And I certainly take some cues from the medical and the research communities that , &nbsp;seem to overwhelmingly favor frequently stats. </p><p>Guido: [00:24:58] Yeah. So what would you say , &nbsp;we'll stop at stepping back a bit.</p><p>You said that we'd been , &nbsp;you've been doing this for over 10 years now. What are you, are there any insights you think you've gathered in those 10 years? It's that other people, or maybe it's zero or in e-commerce in general? I haven't picked up on yet. </p><p>Merritt: [00:25:17] One thing I'm a little bit.</p><p>Cynical. Like I've had too many servings of humble pie , &nbsp;to be too overconfident about any single one of my opinions, but usually one of the things that sticks with me to someone, someone asked Daniel Kahneman , &nbsp;he's the thinking fast and slow. He's the granddaddy of biases and heuristics, right? Someone asked him once , &nbsp;if understanding the biases that he did, the Follies and human thinking, if that made him more resilient.</p><p>To those biases. And , &nbsp;and he said, no , &nbsp;not really. And I think that's true of us in the CRO community, right? Like we, we tend to look for ways to exploit's maybe, , &nbsp;too loaded of a term, but we look for ways to speak to some of those biases and to like to work within the system of human psychology.</p><p>And. You would think that we'd be really good at understanding how our own thinking is wad. And I think we're not. And I think that manifests itself in myriad ways and the way we approach our work. But one of those is sometimes we see what we, we make emotional decisions.</p><p>We live in a world of data. And we use that data like &nbsp;a security blanket, right? Like it makes us feel good about the decisions we're making. But I think there's a propensity for us to make emotional decisions still and to use the data as a weapon to rationalize those emotional decisions.</p><p>And I've seen it in my own work. I've seen it in other people's work where you take these hard numbers and these stats and you just put enough. Spin on it, enough of a personal interpretation on it. , &nbsp;that's where a lot of like P hacking comes from. And even if you like build up more and more sophisticated, Stats methods to , &nbsp;to make your S Europe to make your , &nbsp;conclusion seem more Bulletproof, like opinions still seeps in.</p><p>And , &nbsp;and I think that's something we have to actively combat. Throughout our careers , &nbsp;maybe babysit others , &nbsp;as well. But that's my opinion is that there's way too much opinion in all the work that we do as much as we want to believe that , &nbsp;you, we're using cold numbers to make decisions.</p><p>Guido: [00:27:36] Yeah. Yeah. This should be an app that says warns you for all the fellow CS. That's your , &nbsp;All the biases that's going to drive. This is probably not there yet.</p><p>In my experience. It does help if you , &nbsp;if you talk a lot with , &nbsp;people doing the same as you do, , &nbsp;but outside of your company , &nbsp;the interest groups , &nbsp;of course nowadays everything align , &nbsp;maybe it's a Facebook group for you or a Slack group for people do zero. Or meetup.com more than way.</p><p>And when we're back to doing that , &nbsp;and talk to those people too, to figure out and discuss the experiments that you run with them. I think that always helps me, , &nbsp;to figure those out swore to get a hint as to where I'm going wrong. </p><p>Merritt: [00:28:14] Yeah. Yeah. There's another thing that comes to mind. You're talking about insights that , &nbsp;Let's call these opinions that I have, that this was shared maybe a safer way to present that.</p><p>I also, I like to say that ideas are a dime, a dozen &nbsp;in, in CRO we learn a lot again about those same biases and the tactics that work and the heuristics that we should evaluate a page with. And the , &nbsp;how design works and how colors work, how words work, and then the impact they have on consumers and people as they experience , &nbsp;different user interfaces.</p><p>But at the end of the day, right? , &nbsp;our ability to use those things, to actually make a difference to business metrics is pretty bad. We need to know that stuff and it makes our ideas better. But going from a 25% win rate to a 35% win rate. It's still a 55%. It's still more just for the record.</p><p>He is seven out of 10 of your ideas are still not good. So I like, again, the humble pie that I've eaten over the years, I have to remind myself constantly whenever I hear someone sharing an idea that I think is absolutely terrible. Poorly reasoned, like just like in bad taste. Like I have to remind myself that, you know what, my ideas aren't any better.</p><p>I've put my weight behind stuff that I thought was sure to win and flopped me no difference. We're just not that good at finding the solution the first time. Not to say that it's not worth putting in the hard work to learn about what tends to work, what should work.</p><p>At the end of the day, our ideas just aren't that great. And so like, when I find myself arguing with &nbsp;about what tests should we move forward with? Or like, how should we prioritize this idea? Man, it's , &nbsp;we should just all do ourselves a favor. It acknowledged that </p><p>Guido: [00:30:04] yeah, we don't know.</p><p>So I have a statement for you then. , &nbsp;if you, if your win rate is 35% or up , &nbsp;you're not testing enough. </p><p>Merritt: [00:30:14] Yeah. Yeah. And honestly, most of the organizations that I work with art testing enough, because once they have learned to flex that muscle really well and really quickly, they don't need a, they don't need a consultant or an agency to come in and show them how to do it anymore.</p><p>Like they're beyond us. If that's just a, yeah. That's true. Those are just the problems that I work with on a daily basis. But yeah, the mature organizations, those that run a lot of tests, their win rates go way down one in 10, maybe even less than that. And that should tell us something, right?</p><p>Guido: [00:30:46] Yeah. I'm asking you, I think that the public number, a booking booking.com always, , &nbsp;using their presentation is one in 10. And I know from , &nbsp;from Microsoft, they do all these automated tests, right? So on their own, there are being search engine and there's one in a couple of thousands , &nbsp;experiments that actually move the needle of words.</p><p>Merritt: [00:31:06] And I've heard , &nbsp;People like Tom whistling , &nbsp;say on stage that, our ideas are so bad that we shouldn't even bother with them. Like the future of CRO is letting the machine try every single iteration of an experience and just let the machine do it because, we, we are limited in what we can think might work and , &nbsp;we bring a whole, we bring a whole bunch of baggage behind us.</p><p>Of assumptions that may not be right. And so just, letting the machine take care of design is the future of Sierra. I don't know that. I agree with that again. I do think it's worth putting in the hard work to understand how brains work, how interfaces work. What's , &nbsp;what's good design, what's bad design.</p><p>What tactics we should try or what other people have tested and works. I do think it's worth like educating ourselves on that, but. Yeah. Especially the more tests you run and the more you reach that local maximum, which is , &nbsp;you're actually optimized the harder those wins , &nbsp;are to find.</p><p>Guido: [00:32:04] Yeah. So I run , &nbsp;experiments , &nbsp;with that same domestic a couple of years ago with, , &nbsp;Dan gold sentience AI. , &nbsp;this , &nbsp;evolutionary algorithm, AI AB testing or multi-variate testing platform. And, , &nbsp;but the thing is that , &nbsp;you, you can, yeah, sure. You can feed it all these, but basically it's like a multi-armed bandits, &nbsp;, &nbsp;algorithm , &nbsp;and in, in separate stages.</p><p>But the limitation does those machines still have. I think is that , &nbsp;of course they can find the optimum solution of the variance you give it. Where's that, do you think we will still, as Sierra people will still be valuable that way so we can give the machine, maybe the machine can figure it out and do all that and completely automated, but do we, are we still needed a future , &nbsp;to figure out what the machine is going to test </p><p>Merritt: [00:32:53] to begin with?</p><p>And the more. The more power you give to that machine to just operate independently, right? It's it's literally going to move every pixel to every point on the screen. And it may learn very quickly that way, of what works and where that pixel needs to be. But somebody out there is going to see.</p><p>Greek letters were in an English setting, right? Somebody is going to see something that doesn't make any sense that a human could very easily say , &nbsp;hold on. , &nbsp;no. We're not going to try that one. But operate within these boundaries. So yeah, I don't see like the machines taking over completely anytime soon.</p><p>They're just not smart enough to get Get the first couple of iterations, right? Like they, they just, they have to be trained and learn. I don't know. Maybe there's some solution out there where you can have the trainer set internally that helps the machine like learn some basics. And then from there it can just go wild.</p><p>Yeah. That'd be interesting. But I also wonder , &nbsp;here's the other limitation, right? The , &nbsp;You have to be , &nbsp;really confident that the metric you're optimizing for encompasses everything that you're interested in. And that's even a problem today in our decision-making right. Where you may find something that's ugly and hideous and.</p><p>Evokes a, like a gut wrenching response from people, but it's super effective at drawing clicks or getting people to check out or getting people to accidentally enter in their credit card information and buy. And you're just not measuring the metric of like, how do they feel when they see that?</p><p>Or like what's their likelihood of coming back six months from now to buy from me again or next year to buy from me again. Whereas those metrics are always seemed to be just a little out of reach and we want to acknowledge them and use them in our decision making models. If you just set a machine to optimize for that stuff, it's.</p><p>It's not gonna take every data point in account. I don't know. </p><p>Guido: [00:34:51] You probably end up that's what a lot of CEOs are struggling with. You probably won't optimize for lifetime value, but that's the only metric that you can often, you don't have to have that available in Google analytics or whatever you use to analyze your AB test for.</p><p>So you have to settle for proxies like conversion rates or average order value or revenue per visitor or whatever are you're , &nbsp;doing it with, but it's very, short-term what's, we're optimizing for right </p><p>Merritt: [00:35:14] now. Yeah. Or what if you like , &nbsp;what if you're a luxury brand, and like just</p><p>the feeling of it, the feeling of what you're presenting is every bit as important as the , &nbsp;the action that the user takes, right? Like you, you have to prioritize how people experience your brand. And if you just run a test on conversion rate, that's not what you're necessarily optimizing for.</p><p>Guido: [00:35:43] Yeah. And so if you're listening to this is basically , &nbsp;the survival instinct of two people working in Ciro, trying to figure out how our job can still exist in 10 years. We're desperately looking for four ways to figure out, okay, it's not going to happen.</p><p>Merritt: [00:36:04] How many of us have looked at, or how many of us have tried to dictate something to our phone? And I don't know about you, but for me &nbsp;there are certain words that every single, like every time I say the word com E come on over here, it'll say cone. Even when I'm typing code every single time, every time I see that, I'm like, yeah, no, the machines aren't coming for us anytime soon.</p><p>We're good. We're fine. </p><p>Guido: [00:36:29] I have that on my main frustration that, that pops up , &nbsp;right now is that I think it's , &nbsp;mainly LinkedIn when I tried to reply to someone , &nbsp;on the message that they sent, I think it's even like the public posts. And I tried to add mention them. And then there's all this big list of people that has the same , &nbsp;starting letter, but it's not a person that's rod, this person let's pause.</p><p>I'm like, this should be the Mo the most obvious one. Why is that? Not there. So now we're all safe the next 10 years. We're good. Yeah. Very good. , &nbsp;back to you &nbsp;you're a calculator. You just released a version two. What's going to happen in the next 12 months. Is there going to be your version three?</p><p>Is there already a roadmap. </p><p>Merritt: [00:37:12] I do have a backlog of ideas and features and stuff that I'd like to work in. I'm really excited about some of the things that came out and B2, some stuff to geek out about. But yeah, next 12 months , &nbsp;I do want to put in support for continuous metrics. It's not that hard.</p><p>It's just one of those things that just takes that takes the time to do it and reframe everything and then working that into the user interface. Honestly for me though. I didn't set out to build this tool set. I set up to just understand things better and it took me to , &nbsp;I need it.</p><p>I need a tool to be able to do what I want here. </p><p>Guido: [00:37:50] That's scratching your own itch, but that's a great way to start crying. </p><p>Merritt: [00:37:54] Yeah. And I think there are a number of other tools , &nbsp;that could the valuable in our space. One of the things , &nbsp;one of the things that I've learned is that simulating is it can actually improve your decision-making.</p><p>If you can see the way scenarios play out , &nbsp;you can. You see the impact in the weight of what you're doing. I think back to , &nbsp;effect simulation was one of the ways that I got into this in the first place is I wanted to know what happened when people peaked. I wanted to know what the actual impact of peaking was.</p><p>And the only way I could figure how to do that was to like simulate a bunch of data and look at different scenarios. What happened to someone peaked after 50% of the sample versus after 10% of the sample. I'm like, I actually thought there maybe was like, This is not done. I am. I thought there was maybe some way that , &nbsp;you can have a rule of thumb on how to peak without messing up your stats.</p><p>And that's not the case. They'll do it. But. Yeah. I think there's a lot, there's some tools and stuff that we could add in to different calculators that would give people an ability to simulate data and see how those things play out. I also, personally, from a personal perspective, next 12 months, I do want to get through those Beijing.</p><p>I've read so many articles and I dunno. Thick skulled with this stuff, but , &nbsp;yeah. I want to be able to give you a clear answer on , &nbsp;how you use sequential testing Beijing stats next year. </p><p>Guido: [00:39:17] Yeah. So to continue on that , &nbsp;any other things you're reading our tip for our listeners , &nbsp;to develop themselves in this , &nbsp;this area?</p><p>Merritt: [00:39:28] Yeah, a couple of things. I, , &nbsp;the number of bloggers and content creators out there has just blossomed in the past five years , &nbsp;in terms of experimentation, if you go on medium and even if you only do a free subscription meet the amount of AB testing content on medium is huge. I get a weekly digest and there's new articles every week from people that I've never heard of.</p><p>A lot of like more common experimentation blogs are on there. Netflix does their stuff on medium. So I'd say go subscribe to &nbsp;a couple of topics of interest on medium and see what comes out on a weekly or daily digest. The other thing that I think is really astonishing, the good , &nbsp;Alex Burquette , &nbsp;over the past year has been building up some of the content on his personal blog, Alex briquette.com and , &nbsp;his stuff is really good.</p><p>It's really thorough and well thought out and , &nbsp;he comes at it from someone who has learned in the trenches. So his blog is a great place for someone to actually get started today in understanding AB testing. Cause it's really spans the breadth. It's comprehensive.</p><p>Guido: [00:40:32] Was he doing he's a Ciro specialist, right? What is </p><p>Merritt: [00:40:36] he doing today? He, I think he's doing, he's doing is he's like a freelance , &nbsp;today he's doing his own company. But he was, he's been , &nbsp;he's been a writer. He worked for HubSpot. He worked for a CXL. I think he did a bunch of content for CXL and then he's just , &nbsp;he's been put on great stuff.</p><p>Guido: [00:40:53] Speaking of people , &nbsp;who should we invite for , &nbsp;for another podcast episode? </p><p>Merritt: [00:40:59] Have you spoken to not yet. Okay. You need to get your shots. No , &nbsp;Matt is great. He owns and runs, conduct tricks. He's a, he's very present in the industry and he's just a thoughtful, he's , &nbsp;he's a kind , &nbsp;kind guy, , &nbsp;as, as rough as he is around the edges, it's prickly as he is around the edges.</p><p>Sometimes I will tell you that I know he's very smart guy, very willing to , &nbsp;to educate people. And, , &nbsp;he's just a clear thinker about a lot of things. </p><p>Guido: [00:41:27] No, we'll, , &nbsp;I'll connect him and , &nbsp;I'm , &nbsp;I'll tell him, you told us , &nbsp;on the shoulders. Good. Thank you so much, , &nbsp;for sharing this , &nbsp;this with us , &nbsp;Meredith things really interesting and definitely looking forward to the basion update.</p><p>,</p><p> My, my final question for you , &nbsp;How often do you pick personally, what's your rule for it?</p><p>Merritt: [00:41:48] Remember peaking is just when you calculate the statistics. , &nbsp;no, I, I use this method in almost every test that I designed , &nbsp;For clients. And , &nbsp;the only time I don't is when there's a stats engine with the test tool that I trust and that I think is putting out good stuff. , &nbsp;there are some tools out there that I think have good stats methods behind them.</p><p>But for the most part, I'm doing all of it offline , &nbsp;using mental calculator. So </p><p>Guido: [00:42:12] You can name names, but let's just not name them. The bad ones were the very good ones we want to know. </p><p>Merritt: [00:42:19] Google optimize has it BeiGene engine. And did, they're not completely straight forward with it.</p><p>And there are a lot of gutches with their stats, but , &nbsp;But I tend to trust their engine. , &nbsp;I trust, optimize these engine as well. I trust the BWS engine. Con conductor X is great on the , &nbsp;machine learning side and I trust their stats engine, the problem with some of the others.</p><p>It's not that they're, it's not that their stats are wrong. It's that they're easy to abuse. It's that like you, can't just, I think of in terms of Can I send my client there to get results? Can I share this with them and let them like interpret it as they want to every time. And I don't do that with target.</p><p>I don't do that with anything that's frequent. This that doesn't have some adjustment or some sort of mechanism to stop them from interbreeding at a test statistic before the sample size is being collected. Fair enough. </p><p>Guido: [00:43:18] Thank you so much. Maritz and , &nbsp;hope to talk to you soon. Thanks. Bye-bye.</p><p>‍</p>",false,

We have Chris Lee and John Dawson. </p><p>John Dawson: [00:00:04] Welcome. Um, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:00:06] first off, uh, um, I'll ask you to introduce yourself who wants to go first? </p><p>John Dawson: [00:00:11] Chris? </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:00:11] I'll go first. I I'm, uh, Chris me on the head of marketing effectiveness or GVC GBC is one of the world's largest sports betting and gaming. Okay. </p><p>John Dawson: [00:00:22] And I'm John Dawson. I'm the managing director of scam Marcie QBD.</p><p>So we're based over here in Utrecht. And I've been working with Chris at GVC for the past five years to help them build their team and build their capability. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:00:34] Yeah. And Chris, you did a talk this morning, um, a workshop or talk </p><p>John Dawson: [00:00:40] and workshop, workshop, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:00:42] workshop. I think the empty out one of the world's largest gaming companies improve the odds of marketing success.</p><p>So tell me, what was it about. </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:00:51] So as a, as an organization, we spend about half a billion euros every year marketing our, uh, different brands. Yeah. Uh, in the UK, across Europe, uh, S uh, South America in terms of, uh, Brazil, Australia, and yeah, that's, uh, it's a lot of money to invest. And so as an organization, what we want to do first and foremost, understand is what is that delivery in terms of value?</p><p>To us as a, an organization in terms of money, bottom line revenue, but also, you know, can we spend that more effectively? Uh, are we, are we over saturating in certain channels? So do we do too much TV advertising relative to, uh, too much display online display advertising? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:40] Yep. And, um, um, well, to me it comes to mind a famous quote.</p><p>I think it was this attribute to Coca-Cola that most of your marketing. When he spends, </p><p>John Dawson: [00:01:52] lots of people have had that achievements. </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:01:55] John Wanamaker, </p><p>John Dawson: [00:01:56] I believe is one of them want </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:01:58] to make a half of my marketing dollars. I believe he said was wasted just to know which half. Exactly. And that's, you know? Yeah, we do.</p><p>It's actually not as simple as that. So, um, But it's less than half it's, less than half I think. Yeah. Yeah. I think my CFO would, uh, have a bit of a fit if you knew that 250 million euros were being wasted. Uh, so it's not a case of brilliant that that is wasted. It's just inefficiently targeted. So it's making sure that your you're not, uh, you're targeting your funds.</p><p>So it's in there is where you're going to get the better return. Versus something else. So, I mean, if you've seen a TV commercial five times, do you need to see six, seven, eight times? Probably not. You've already got the message and therefore, you know, reinforcement of the brand through the channels. Um, whether it's, you know, if you're on a website and you see a banner, uh, or you're driving your car, you see a billboard where you're listening to the radio, then maybe that's more effectively spending those channels rather than.</p><p>Uh, halftime when I act are five Nyla, but yeah. So, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:12] so the workshop was mainly about sharing your experience. </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:03:14] Yeah. Sharing the experience about how we've done that. So, uh, we started off, um, uh, how </p><p>long </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:03:21] ago? </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:03:22] So we started in 2016, so we're into our fifth year now. So we didn't, uh, we ha we had an effectiveness capability, but we, it wasn't best in class.</p><p>And it had these deficiencies. So, uh, we re we, we sell a program of work. We focus it on focused on three UK brands, our main three UK brands, which is laboratory coral and gala bingo. Um, we've served as godly, uh, consolidators, that program of work automated. It makes sure that we're getting to the answer quicker.</p><p>Uh, and then we were acquired by GVC in. Uh, uh, 20, 2018 and now we've expanded it to the full portfolio. Uh, so it's, uh, it's an ongoing program of work. It's not something that will stop, uh, but it's embedded it's in the organization. You know, we are regularly chatting to different stakeholders, not just marketing, but finance operations, uh, our partners, our media agency, our suppliers, like, uh, &nbsp;um, To, to keep it, to keep it moving forward and, and, and, uh, evolving.</p><p>Um, that's the thing. It's, once you've got the answer, you want something different and something new. And so it's, what is that evolution? Um, and that's where the &nbsp;come in, come to the fall. </p><p>John Dawson: [00:04:53] So I think one thing to add to that, Chris is you talk about marketing effectiveness. But the, the scope of the analysis you do covers promotions covers other business drivers events.</p><p>It's a much broader business driver analysis, I guess, that you actually perform. So, although the optimization is very much on the marketing side and increasing the values on the marketing side, you help the business understand a hell of a lot more than, than the advertising impacts. You help them understand different events.</p><p>What's the likely impact of this event next year and these kinds of promotional plans. So it, it goes deep and it goes very broad. </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:05:31] Yeah. Yeah, it does. I think the, you know, we're all, uh, well I personally, I say I used to, I don't gamble, uh, if for a gambling company and I don't gamble. Uh, but that's not, that's not because I see money </p><p>John Dawson: [00:05:48] make </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:05:48] money.</p><p>Uh, No, I never have to know. It's never been a, it's not been something that's, uh, that, that appeals to me, but I'm a sports fanatic. So, you know, every, every other summer there's a football tournament, whether it's the euros this year, world cup in two years' time in Qatar, uh, you know, those are big events.</p><p>And so actually in this sanding, You know, walk what just natural demand that's going to deliver, uh, or whether it's the champions league final. And then again, that's really, those are, that's an important one. Uh, but that's the sports betting side. There's the whole casino online casino, whether that's slots, whether that's, uh, poker, black, Jack, uh, Bakker at, uh, yeah, you can play, you can now play live a live game of poker.</p><p>If you want to with a dealer. There's a creepier there sat across on the table or Nora virtual, the Nora Navitar satchel. Uh, it is an actual croupier, uh, and you can gamble, uh, and people like that, you know, and that's, you know, knock the cow and, uh, Las Vegas have been around for a long, long time. This is just an extension of entertainment and that's where it is people that people like to gamble.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:08] I'm always fascinated by, so my I'm, I may have a background in psychology and I also, uh, I don't gamble. Uh, but we, of course the Vegas is a very popular spot for, for conferences. So a yearly, you have a conference over there. I'm fascinated by how those buildings are set up to keep everyone in to keep everyone happy to keep everyone gambling.</p><p>Chris Lee: [00:07:29] You say you don't gamble, but do you play the lottery? No. No. Okay. You dug down </p><p>John Dawson: [00:07:34] say movies, you just, but you're right. It's, it's, it's so many experiments, natural experiments. And this industry in particular is there's just an enormous amount of data experimentation, uh, done in the right way. You know, that can tell you an awful lot of things about people, how they behave.</p><p>Um, you just gotta be doing it in the right way. Yeah. So, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:56] do you know, what kind of companies joined you for the workshop this morning? What was what's kind of, </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:08:02] uh, he </p><p>John Dawson: [00:08:03] was too early. Everyone was, yes, they did. So coming in at the last minute, I know, I, I know we had a local companies. I think we have people from other parts of Europe as well in there from the people I spoke to both advertisers, themselves, brand owners of research agencies.</p><p>So there's a, there's a really good mix here, actually with </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:23] different companies. And then what did you get? Kind of, uh, certain questions from the audience, what kind of </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:08:30] information we run out of time? So, uh, I mean, one question was, how do you know, how do you do this? Uh, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:08:37] what, where do you even start? </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:08:39] Where do you start?</p><p>John Dawson: [00:08:40] So, </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:08:42] yeah. Yeah, voodoo. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:08:44] It can, can seem overwhelming, especially if you don't have anything like you had a few years ago. Like, how do you start measuring anything at all? And then actually using that to improve things. </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:08:56] It shouldn't be surprising because we are in the data age, but the data's there. Uh, some of it is hard to get or harder to get.</p><p>Uh, but most of it is, is now captured a standard. You, you know, um, you did, you don't realize that it probably is, but, um, visually everything that we do as, as. Individuals is captured in some form, uh, well, in, in, in some sort of form, you know, we know this is, um, you know, how many people are watching TV at any one point in time, how many people are doing it on a dual screen, um, versus how many people are online searching for the different brands.</p><p>So, although information is there, it's, it's being able to then capture all of that. I'm bringing you together and say, well, what relationships can I see? And if I can't see those relationships, that helps me quantify. And if I can quantify, I can therefore optimize, how </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:56] big is the team doing </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:09:57] this? So the team is, so there are, we're a mixture actually.</p><p>So we're a mixture of internal and external. So internally we are seven at the moment, uh, externally we've probably got about the same number of people. So, uh, and those, those are from our partners. So we're not scared of doing is actually using outside parties. You could build this yourself, but if you're going to build it yourself, you're going to have to have a much larger workforce because people leave, people become sick.</p><p>Um, but you still have deadlines to hit. So, uh, it's actually a better model to have a hybrid where you've got part of it internally. Cause then you get to witness field CA see here. What's happening with the organization, uh, and then meld that with the expertise and technical expertise that you get from a supplier like, uh, Scott, Rudy, </p><p>John Dawson: [00:10:51] can I, I mean, I think just going back to the question about how do we do this actually at the right at the beginning, you talked about this in your talk today, you broke it down into four elements.</p><p>You know, you talked about what are the business processes we need to influence, not just one of the current processes, but what could the processes be if we had more insights. What data you actually had available? You did an awful lot of work around data pipelines and the practical stuff. Uh, we supplied the tools and we, we helped all of these elements scammer, but specifically we supplied some tools that really help you get insights out of the data quickly.</p><p>And then the training, I think you trained people internally, how to do things. You also train people internally how to interpret and how to take actions. From the insights that you, you were able to provide. So when they come be confident about things and actually when there was some uncertainty, see, I think you were pretty open with saying, you have to understand.</p><p>And of course this is one industry that understands risk, right. Explicitly understands risks. So I think you have a great opportunity there. So yeah, it's process data tools and people. In that, and those are the four things that we set up as a program and have developed and evolved over time. Yeah. I'm interested in it.</p><p>So, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:08] um, uh, we both were both work in digital marketing. Um, um, I personally work in optimization, either running experiments, running AB tests. And what does he at a lot of companies, uh, and, and you name it, those four elements. We see a very, um, well, I would say at this balance in investments, a lot of a lot goes into tools.</p><p>It's apparently very easy to buy tools a was really hard or apparently it doesn't happen, uh, to invest in people and the knowledge buildup. Uh </p><p>John Dawson: [00:12:38] how's that well, can I say something to the cause as a tools provider, right? We make tools, those tools don't land. If the people can't use it. Exactly. So, yeah, it's actually on us to provide the resources, to provide the learning.</p><p>We S we provide you online e-learning certification, but. And miles aside, you know, there's no substitute for being in the same room and actually taking people through this and it's a learning process. So I think from, from our side, we absolutely recognize that I think what we had was a client who was prepared to.</p><p>Uh, and, and acknowledged and understood that this was really important and it does take time. Yeah. Uh, they want one thing this industry has, is, and if you look at financial services and telcos, you got the same thing, you've got data literate people, and you had a lot of data list for people. What was maybe lacking was how do we communicate some of this stuff?</p><p>How do we take the most advantage of it? </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:13:38] Yeah, it is. I think, uh, If you think back to your school days, you know, you ask anybody, you know, what was the worst subject that you stood at? And everyone got maths, everyone hated maths. It was like the lesson that everyone wanted to try and avoid other than the geeks as it were.</p><p>So, um, so what, I mean, a good, a good practitioner will try and actually, um, Dismiss some of the myths around it, because it is complex. You know, some of the mathematics is complex, but you don't need to know that as a market here, you don't need to know that I've used a nonlinear transformation on a certain variable.</p><p>Um, you know, what you're interested in is that for every Euro that I've invested that you get, and then I'm getting a Euro 20 back in terms of investments. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:37] I used to be able to interpret what the tool, whatever the </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:14:40] tools. </p><p>John Dawson: [00:14:41] Yeah. But that's also, you know, the tools themselves need to demystify things a bit.</p><p>There's um, Uh, I don't know if you guys have it here. We have, uh, in the UK we have the magic circle, right? So magicians have to keep all these things secret. How do you do the call tricks? It all has to be a big secret. If you reveal the secret, you get thrown out of the institution. And there's a bit of that, I think at the analytical community, God, if we tell these people how we really do it, right, you can't really tell them what the methods are.</p><p>I think you should have a, I think you actually have to have a, uh, uh, a state of mind that says there's no black box here. If you can't. See inside. If you can't trust it, if you don't understand where it's coming from, you're not going to use it. So again, it's, we have to demystify, uh, we have to try and use plain language, simple language, and people will put it towards them.</p><p>If it's going to benefit them, they're going to put it towards them and they'll get value from it. Um, it's when they don't know what they're doing when they don't know why they're doing something, they're just pushing a button. Doesn't work. </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:15:42] No. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:15:43] Yeah, my, my experience is actually, uh, more, more, like you said that it's not that people that they can't understand, but most of them just don't really care.</p><p>They just want to know what did you learn and how do we apply </p><p>John Dawson: [00:15:55] this? Tell me what to do. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:15:57] Yeah, exactly. Black </p><p>John Dawson: [00:15:58] box black box marketing, right? Yeah. It doesn't work. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:16:00] Nope. But, but, but, but most people who are not into the analytics, like maybe we are, tend to think that way, like, all right. I just want to know what, what I need to do next.</p><p>Chris Lee: [00:16:11] It's funny. You should say that because the, uh, I've tried first presented to our CEO at the time. Uh, yeah, after the meeting, he told me to go inside. He goes, Chris, what should I do? Um, and he, you know, he wasn't interested in the math. He just was interested in now, what do I do differently? And, uh, I said, well, these are the results.</p><p>This is why he says we've ever spent in this area. So we need to pull back. And there's an opportunity in this area. Um, and it was very simple, you know, and he didn't need it. You know, he didn't need to know the complex math. We, we used to actually get to the answer and for him, that was fine. He could then, uh, empower his CFO so they can go, go.</p><p>And actually, yeah, it was cute. </p><p>John Dawson: [00:16:56] Was that, was that shock, Chris? </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:16:59] It was the formation, very famous </p><p>John Dawson: [00:17:00] chart we showed today. </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:17:03] Uh, yeah, so it. What we did was, uh, it's your typical pitch layout that your manager, your football manager would use with a little, uh, circular desks till you've got your goalkeeper, your defense, your midfield, and, uh, your attack.</p><p>And so, uh, we use that analogy because again, he was a big sports person, um, around, well, what are your. What w who's your midfield, who is your midfield? And the midfield for us is it's our TV advertising. It's our print advertising our radio, all of that above the line communication. That's your zip powerhouse?</p><p>That's you're the one that generates your demand of starts feeding all of the balls forward. Either out to the wings where we have, um, our partners in terms of our affiliates. Or to your center forward the center forward being branded PPC, branded search. So when you're going to Google and type in a brand, you know, you want that brand to be the number one brand that's up on the list.</p><p>And so, but that's really not. That's just providing a purpose. It's your star striker. It's your Christian Christiana, Rinaldo, or Lionel Messi. You feed them the ball and the ball is being fed by your TV, your midfield, and they'll stick it away every time. But you still need the, your defense. You need your CRM activity.</p><p>You need your bonus, your promotions, the things that really defend your brand against attack. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:37] That's a good strategy. Just figure out the sports. A analogy that you should use or whatever sports, the person you're talking to likes then. </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:18:45] Yeah. Thankfully he was, he was a folk, you know, he liked, he liked his football, so yeah, where it's suddenly like water polo and then good heavens </p><p>John Dawson: [00:18:57] in the communications.</p><p>Right. You've been a communications game. Our audience wants to be communicated to efficiently and effectively. And that was brilliant example. I thought </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:19:06] of taking something simple. Yeah, taking something complex and, um, presenting it in a very simple, but easy to understand, uh, fashion, uh, and that worked and really worked for him well, so, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:19:18] and what are the most interesting or most noticeable things you've, you've come across in the last few years?</p><p>Things you might, maybe you didn't </p><p>John Dawson: [00:19:26] expect or, um, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:19:29] something you had to present in a football analogy, </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:19:32] football analogy. I think, uh, Well, there's no analogy to this. Um, but what is w what it certainly has shown us is how much of our marketing is having an effect on our existing customer base. So the marketing of dominance has been seen, we're seen as an acquisition tool thing to get people into the brand, through the door, as it were the virtual door, because we were looking at this sentence of a digital digital brands, uh, But actually quantifying that probably 40% of our return is coming from our existing customers.</p><p>And, you know, you think, well, actually when you step back, I think, yeah. Actually stands to reason. You know, we are, you know, they, that they're going to be influenced just as much as a new customer to reengage age with the brand. Uh, sorry. That's a big, I mean, that's been, that's been huge for us, uh, but also because.</p><p>Some channels have more of an influence on our existing customer base. Um, and that has helped re rebalanced the view of what marketing does, um, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:20:44] which channels might be specifically useful. </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:20:48] Yeah. Yeah. It's your, I mean, your mass communication channels. So a mass communication being TV and print. Um, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:54] I see there's a lot of companies that, that marketing is getting is getting confused with sales.</p><p>A lot of marketing teams have sales targets while that doesn't necessarily. </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:21:04] Yeah. That's where we are. Even our market is at sales targets in terms of number of new newly acquired customers. So </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:13] focused on new customers. </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:21:14] Yeah. I mean, that's massively important if you don't acquire customers in the long run, you'll have no customers.</p><p>So it still is. It's still is important. Uh, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:24] But not the sole thing </p><p>John Dawson: [00:21:25] yeah. To focus </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:21:26] on. Yeah. Yeah. But, but then, you know, you will, if you're just focused on acquisition, you'll focus on the channels which drive acquisition. And that doesn't necessarily mean that you will drive your brand in the long run, because what we want to be is we want to be here in five, 10, 15, 20 years.</p><p>You know, everyone, everyone wants to, to maintain, uh, maintain a brand, but also grow a brand. Uh, and so it's been important for that. So, </p><p>John Dawson: [00:21:57] yeah. And you did, you know, that longterm view is something that guys very much consider. It's not just the short term ism because actually on the acquisition only basis, you probably are short term.</p><p>You're going to under invest by understanding those broader context. The fear of course, doing these exercises is always it's been done for the accounts. This is how we cut the budget is how we put money to the bottom line. Very often when you do these things, you realize that the value we're undervaluing, some of these activities, actually yes, there might be a case to invest more or maybe invest differently as well, even, you know, things that are surprising, traditional channels still work.</p><p>Yeah. Um, it's not always popular. And the interesting thing, you know, a lot of marketers make the mistake of thinking their customers are like them. There's a, there's a really famous chart that shows, you know, if you go around media agencies and they say, where do people consume media? How do they consume it?</p><p>Media, media, people, media planners, generally get this completely wrong. They under yeah. Estimate what the real population does. So, yeah. Um, the great thing about data is it it's data is generally, uh, an independent, unbiased source. And that's, that's one of the reasons you look at the data </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:09] you don't, if you don't have the data, my most popular department to go through for feedback is customer service.</p><p>Yeah, </p><p>John Dawson: [00:23:14] yeah, yeah, yeah. That's true. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:16] Yeah. They usually have a pretty good idea about what, the things that are going wrong, or at least </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:23:21] what Christmas what's going wrong as sales. Usually he </p><p>John Dawson: [00:23:24] knows what </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:23:24] works. So if you go to those </p><p>John Dawson: [00:23:26] too, </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:23:26] yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:29] Uh, thank you so much for coming here. Uh, any, any else, any specific topics, uh, at the conference today or tomorrow that you look forward to learning more about</p><p>John Dawson: [00:23:44] sustainability is going on, but we've, we've missed that one. I don't know. </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:23:48] I feel like I've seen the VR machine, so, ah, I haven't seen a VR </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:52] machine yet </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:23:53] down there. Um, that's good. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:56] Yeah, that was my lunch break. </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:23:57] Yeah. Well my would be selling law. It's got a, an Oculus for Christmas, so, uh, that's really cool by the way.</p><p>John Dawson: [00:24:06] That's nice. Yeah. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:24:08] The speaker, before you told us about a talk, that's coming up about the &nbsp;museum and how they, um, optimized it for, uh, where people look. So they did research on where do people look, what kind of paintings and are long, and they optimize the museum. For debt. So that </p><p>John Dawson: [00:24:26] might be interesting.</p><p>Yeah. Very cool. Very cool. There's some really good stuff on programs. So looking forward to it. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:33] A final question. Is your presentation available online or will be </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:24:36] yes, it will be </p><p>John Dawson: [00:24:37] perfect. Yeah, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:38] we can link to that in the show notes. </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:24:40] Okay. Cool. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:42] Thank you so much and have a good day. </p><p>Chris Lee: [00:24:43] Thanks you too. Thank you.</p><p>Bye bye.</p><p>‍</p>",,

That's not a thing for most of us. in recent years, there are some colleges picking this up.</p><p>but for most of us, that's not our background. So we would love to know. How'd you get started with this and, how did you roll into zero as a profession? </p><p>Sumantha: [00:00:27] awesome. first off, a lot to be heard a great podcast. I've been listening to other episodes and, you're right.</p><p>CRO is not taught in schools and things like that. Forming it started off, it's really strange, I started optimizing storylines and scripts and things like that by watching movies. Yeah. I, one of my first movies that I saw in a church, it was just </p><p>Guido: [00:00:51] the original </p><p>Sumantha: [00:00:52] it's back then in 94.</p><p>Yeah. 1994, since then it started, relaying out. Okay. What if the director had made the skirt in a different order? Or what if there was a flaw and the director did not took it up or the film crew did not pick it up. what if it was jealousy Parkin and those are playing fingerboard, right?</p><p>that's incorrect. not saying that was thing in Jurassic park, but there's so many such misses that you get to see, especially by, by waiting all this work and you have to carry that, that in your. </p><p>Guido: [00:01:26] So you were watching those movies, like second-by-second frame by frame to see what they did or </p><p>Sumantha: [00:01:34] flowing.</p><p>It was just flowing. And I got this intrinsic ability where I could actually pick out floss and state that, okay, this is incorrect. that was a natural tendency because, that's way too back in time. but obviously I studied, grew up, did my engineering.</p><p>And information science and engineering, which is equal to information technology where, and then we're clearly, okay. It had this notion of, technological aspects, the limitations of what a particular language could be and how you could increase to your job performance. And I also had this flare towards, in a storytelling and getting the right concept, the right notion, Jesse things as users too.</p><p>So some of the biggest wins that I've got in my AB testing coders is just by understanding how people actually behave, how they interact with their daily life. one of my biggest AB test success is a 500% uplift. And that happens struck, at the dead of night, problems as 2016, were higher where I had a lot of laundry pending and I had to get my washing machine, up.</p><p>and that thing was happening. And, it was watching this, series, which was called, big bang theory, obviously, a lot what I've heard and, I'm an Indian, And I was at the time working for a us site. So how do I learn cultures? And obviously I've been seen Hollywood movies and I know a lot, there's also this, notion where you get to see a certain things.</p><p>Where do you get to visualize certain things in imagining how things are set up, how things are shown and things like that. on one hand, I've got my washing machine, which is running and that is throwing, different kinds of lights and all of that. Yeah. And on the other hand, I'm seeing a television where we're on the tele.</p><p>penny is talking to Sheldon and they're driving in a car. And children is petrified because tiny car, the engine check light on is on, it has got his attention and his petrified there. Okay. the Island in the engine might not be up to the Mark. So I got this readily available notion where I could connect.</p><p>I was working on a lead gen site and I knew audience at the back of my mind where. but not like gangsters, they could, pick up design cues and things like that. we had a pretty big lead gen form and I introduced phone leech and those are dialer, which is blinking.</p><p>and attracting end-user's attention right there. They could click that easily. You speak to a rep and, give them information and collect everything. And this was based on a particular zip code, but we're recovered sources and things like that. And the next day, when I looked up a little knowledge and all of that, I looked up database as well.</p><p>And yeah, it was through the roof too. So that happened because of the simple change. What I did was in adding animate dot CSS for that. And that was blinking in a way where, where people would interact with actual devices and how, what they are used to, that picked.</p><p>and those need for them to actually, </p><p>Guido: [00:04:40] that's a perfect example of cognitive economics and, how people pay attention and, like indeed with Benny in the car, th the Angela does is blinking, or maybe not even bringing it just turned on, but there's always turned on. Nothing happens.</p><p>So apparently it's fine. Nothing happened so far. </p><p>Sumantha: [00:04:57] Yeah. Dot and, it's. No, it's like a learning tip, right here. What I do is, and I'm always learning I'm, I'm like, I'm, I'm on a infinite learning curve, always learning, even with our conversation and things like that.</p><p>You need this, there's always scope for learning, And it's about, we've laid out on this perfect platform where I'm learning from you. I, yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:05:19] That's good. </p><p>Sumantha: [00:05:21] It seems it's the same for all century hearing or seeing stuff or understanding context behind it. So the blinking effect, I got that, the Indian check light is always on, but the blinking effect came down.</p><p>when I was laying down an end of the road, it was a busy stretch that there's so many shops around. but only a medical shop are out of, pharmacy got my attention because it's word was popping out a little bit, I would say. And there was this plus sign that, chemists and farmers use here in India, which is a green plus sign.</p><p>And that was blinking there, like literally hundreds and hundreds of shops. And I still recall just knowing this particular connect because. the sign was blinking and it was direct in the, in the line of sight. So I could, irrespective of big Butch and things like that, which are all pilot to me, I couldn't see them.</p><p>And there's this one tiny board which sticks out. And there's that saying? That's blinking and I know, okay, this is a medical shop. I don't have to break abruptly. I know that's coming up. I could go and walk and that's a feature because there's a lot of scruffy.</p><p>There's a lot of classic Marion as well. </p><p>Guido: [00:06:37] Yeah, traffic is that traffic is a very interesting topic for, some of my, my former, colleagues in the university that are in that area in either, traffic for cars on the roads, or I remember a lot of examples, in my study. I've told it a couple of times a bit.</p><p>My study had done nothing to do at university. I had nothing to do with anything online or offline, examples there, but one of them was for example, with, train drivers, or I think maybe the engineers are there are called the thing. The people staring the trains or guiding them over the tracks.</p><p>And a lot of them were missing signs. like the red signs basically, and then they just drove through them causing accidents. And, so people in my profession started taking pictures. Okay. What did they actually see outside of the, outer side of the windows? And usually it's a big mess.</p><p>you really spread, there are a lot of lines going everywhere, especially when you approach stations. There are a lot of different tracks, a lot of, overhead lines. So with all the power cables and a lot of, there are a lot of signs everywhere. and then you understand, yeah, it's, that's information overload.</p><p>It's very easy to imagine someone missing a sign. So what can we do about that and same thing for regular roads? Yeah. </p><p>Sumantha: [00:07:55] No, absolutely. And that's where, when you're designing systems that are building landing pages or working on a product and thing so that you have to have, this user centered solution in place, God has certain heuristics in place.</p><p>Easily. Things could go wrong, just sitting in their shoes and understanding, okay, how was that &nbsp;is going to perceive, the kind of information that you put. you could stay something which makes sense to you as a business owner or as a practitioner.</p><p>But is that tangible enough, right? is that, is that a hundred percent age being compared to the other person who's reading it because in the end of the day, it's all about the sites and things like that because we want to impact, or, the end-user's perception and the mind. and briskly and obviously, the product has to be, full of value proposition.</p><p>If not, you cannot sell it and that's not how it is. and it's simply that, if you miss out on that step, there's always going to be something like this happen where, you don't know, for example, there's a copywriter who's writing landing page for, but does not know who the audience is.</p><p>What does that include if there's no persona, which is in the back of his mind, the kind of want and kind of pain points that he has, this is not something which, you know, such an in such a way where it communicates all the value propositions and all the benefits in such a way.</p><p>But, as, and when a person reach. My Tom rulers. And he'll take us as in when PB people read content. The, if not the head in agreement, if they're not it's so diverse, then try and reach a common point. What would the other person or different types of personnel, </p><p>Guido: [00:09:39] especially if you have a really wide audience for your website or for your product in general, there can be a lot of different ways.</p><p>people view this, right? that's always what I find very interesting when doing user research and giving people basically the same stimuli, or the same website, the same products, and you get so many different opinions on that. it's a bit like you can imagine. Yeah. those raw SOC tests, that psychologists use, the ink blobs and everyone sees something different.</p><p>And you might not expect this with websites. they're less ambiguous than in blop. You hope, but there's still so many different, ways of fueling something because of your background or whatever, right? </p><p>Sumantha: [00:10:17] Absolutely. Absolutely. your background is different, your cultures are different and you're brought up differently and the way you.</p><p>Yeah, there's also this, tests that I recall off where, I think this was conducted in India where, a person walks up to a group of, children playing and says that, this, this Jeff, children playing from different backgrounds and they're poor children in the rows.</p><p>and as well as rich offend families who are coming and playing in the ground. and do one set, this part of the guy, hands out a box of sweet. And she said, if you're willing to wait 10 more minutes, I'm going to give you the two, two boxes of sweet. Yeah. And guess what happens, Oh, Children from rich and affluent backgrounds can wait because they've already eaten such rich.</p><p>they're going to think okay, 10 more minutes. I'm going to get to two boxes. Sweet. It's not, if everything, all of this was the hooks. There's no water because I ended up having to switch anyway. But if you flip that equation and for a guy from poor background for the child from poor background, cause nobody can a box of sewage.</p><p>He's going to grab that immediately and run away. His entire thing was true. and his, when, if it was going to get two boxes, but it's not going to wait. Yeah. this there's just that urge that is not even sweets. And you want to grab that right now and run it. </p><p>Guido: [00:11:51] Yeah. And there's research going on before with doing this exact test with children right then, and, having that as a, prediction for future success.</p><p>And apparently there's some correlation there, at least with the kids that cam weights. Yeah. there you're more patient and not apparently leads to, or correlates to, more successful. If you're </p><p>Sumantha: [00:12:14] at work, especially the newer age, then you will work for us. And, do you don't know how to delay gratification?</p><p>Yeah. It's okay, I want to join a company. I want to reach this sport. I'm going to do the art. I want to do this. but they do not think for second &nbsp;</p><p>Guido: [00:12:32] and that's how a lot of companies are organized. yeah, you have the most. People work with really short-term incentives, whether that's bonuses or just general appraisal for the work that you do, it's all short-term it's, it needs to be successful this week, this month, this quarter, or these, the longest terms board read this year, but it's still relatively short term.</p><p>If you look at my business and I see that as a, that's an issue, that's a challenge for a lot of people specifically in CRO. because it's your appropriate program is not, if you've set it up properly, it's not going to give a big result in four weeks. </p><p>Sumantha: [00:13:05] Yep. Yep. and it's even if you did get it's, it does not mean that it's going to repeat, Because it's a long learning process because it's not about winners and losers. It's insights that you get and the kind of areas that you apply at, if you're at a larger &nbsp;is making billions of dollars. One such insert is this is really going to give you millions of dollars and uplift and hen rubbing you or an average order value.</p><p>And just imagine a series of AB testing in a test across, in acquisition or across, shopping cards and things like that for over a period of near the cumulative car, traveling for a champion in the impact could be huge. and that's what businesses wouldn't understand. And they're like, Okay. So I'm looking to get this done and in a week I've done, things like that in the past, especially concerning where, there was this, particular, huge, them, but I just, the segment is, lots of fruits and classic fridge, and they've got 300, such.</p><p>Yeah. and, I did a simple tear down of their site and the very next day I'm on a plane, meeting their, VP of product, the VP of engineering, the CTO, for example. Yeah. and that support, that we could spread and that impact that we could actually show it to them.</p><p>and this organization had a lot of, best talent around because they came from premier Indian institutes, Like an inch of technology for a champion product managers, they all started in the nineties. some of the great institutes the world has ever seen because in knowledge, the knowledge that these are institutes predators is much, or the technological process is all of this world.</p><p>and S somewhat the employers were part of this particular organization. They did not know what experimentation was or what conversion rate optimization. Yeah. They're open about it. And that's how you're told to establish that rapport between say a consultant and an internal team member, but where they get to see that.</p><p>Okay. That you're an extension of their arm, basically. Yeah. It's not like you go there and say in, go left and right. And say that you did this wrong tree. Trunk does not how it is done. But gradually build rapport and know what's, what's the inside story. What is that they're working on and how is that you could actually help win and achieve, the benefit for the college.</p><p>Guido: [00:15:30] And that's an interesting point, right? Because you also started, the story when you started watching movies, you said, I, I. I developed a keen eye, to, to see flaws, which is useful as a CRO, but it's not, there's not a, there's not a nice trait to have in conversations or in meetings. Yeah. </p><p>Sumantha: [00:15:50] It's it is, there's this $600 go CRO company, which is doing a lot of good business.</p><p>And you go there and say that you're not doing this. You're not in God. just imagine. if I talk about Apple, for example, a trillion dollar company and I go there to a product and say that you've done this wrong, that wrong. </p><p>Guido: [00:16:09] Exactly. You need to do, you need to do some translation, basically into some nicer words, phrases</p><p>Sumantha: [00:16:17] And it was also about identifying certain patterns with what they've actually done stuff. and, there's already a foundation in and you want to create a structure. Yeah. You want to create a creative regimen where that works like clockwork date, this regimen of experimentation of getting things done.</p><p>And we had what a week's time before the huge ad rollout was, do you hear in India? Massive budgets. and we worked on registration and the organization game a lot. Yeah. And they don't have your sign-ups and, if that thing plays already, almost that uplift actually increases your bottom line as well.</p><p>The number of paid customers, because you're putting in more users, in engaging with other apps and websites and stuff. So say it's about. it's a two way street, right? It's about them realizing that. and did, they did mention that they've got on tuition, that's a great sign that, that's a great sign that the client is willing to put effort as well.</p><p>and for our AB experimentation program, we had the top level priority and I've seen some of the best engineers work, work with me in creating a funnel in interviewing teams. Or, we're probably a floor full of 200 odd product designers, contractors, you are testers, in sub routines and things like that.</p><p>and I hadn't number one priority. that's a boost as well, right? I was the kind of guy who would reach early, I was stationed out there, what place for three to four weeks and on a daily regimen. being one or two worst case, the VP of product could always be, but when I was the last day to walk off, because I ha I had this notion of setting desktop, clearing use from the last day planning the day, or planning next days, activities as well, the roadmap, artistic, because we are at a very tight shadow.</p><p>And, Africa was not a problem at obligation. they get millions and millions of views and it's all about bottom line, right? The kind of conversion uplift we could draw. and there's a new advertising, which, which was about role or pan-India. so TV commercials and things are that they're going take scale on marketing.</p><p>That's where, you know what, in this resume and people actually stuck work in the Roger questions. safe. If I'm getting tens of tests done, I was only implementing the winning Williams and the engineers were like, pissed off because they're like someone that you're getting me to build like 10 pages, but that is not going on.</p><p>Guido: [00:19:00] Yeah, it sounds familiar. </p><p>Sumantha: [00:19:02] Yeah. So that's the education, but wherever you have to come and come here that. Yeah, look, if I say all those things and millions of profit, if I'd rather to just a hundred or audience, and you want to test in such a way where. w what do you like to split 50 50 and test and wait, or what do you do?</p><p>Something which is more incremental? Where would you say that, for the first 10 you play affects, or do you apply a particular and learn from that, and I'll play, all those learnings, that came on along your way and all those insights, aren't the next 10, And that's where you're actually employing your concert.</p><p>and tests that you've done for the first 10 it's tucked away because you built on that. We've made that more robust, made that much better. What, where do you want to stick with that? </p><p>Guido: [00:19:53] w we're already talking for a half an hour. but we haven't actually spoken about what you're actually do.</p><p>So let's do, let's take a small step back. and, so what do you do? it's Kaspersky. Yeah, you're a senior CRO, there w what are the kinds of. Projects, your work role and then how does your team look like and that kind of stuff. That's what we want to know now. </p><p>Sumantha: [00:20:13] Yeah. So basically it's a global channel team.</p><p>it's both centralized and decentralized in a way because it's a huge, routine. and obviously the global charity is everywhere. We are going to the UK. Oh, you got an NGO in Russia, obviously in China and things like that. Yeah. and, one, one, one of the key goals is, or rather for any organization for that matter is improve their landing pages and landing pages is more important because, that's your first touch point, be it appeared.</p><p>I had organic landing pages and things like that. And that's where you want to ensure that. you're giving the best information out there for your end users. you're having certain frameworks and growth models in place, where it works best for a particular region. And again, coming back to that us example, maybe that's something which worked in us might not work in Germany because I don't have that local insight in Germany.</p><p>And that's where you study in and bank on research. and we've got a great, or research team in, in Casper scarce world. </p><p>Guido: [00:21:18] Do you mainly work on the B2B or B2C? </p><p>Sumantha: [00:21:20] it's both. Yeah, it's both. It's both. it, it has its separate parallel tracks obviously. and at times you have to wear a B2B hat while you're working on B2B stuff in H it's more like.</p><p>at least for people, especially for cybersecurity and things that are out for any other bigger enterprise stuff. people might see that as a bit boring or, not as, it's more of a perception where people see that this is a bit life less than we received, but that's not the case.</p><p>You could always tweak things. you might have less traffic, but you've got change to do usability test. you're more a qualitative approach, but where it could bank on certain stuff, </p><p>Guido: [00:22:01] you have less traffic to work with, but the impact can also be bigger. Yeah. </p><p>Sumantha: [00:22:06] Yeah.</p><p>It is bigger. And you could give, or at your own flirt, if the flavor of the Bryant for what it's change, for example, for what reason, Kaspersky signs, what he thinks and believes in what the organization. and that's the kind of impact that could be drawing than being more saturated than thinking of this portal opinion that no, the enterprise Plains Lake something, which is saturated and playing and big chunks of text and things like that.</p><p>Yeah. it's more about being, or ensuring that flavor. and capturing the attention of, in the B2B second, because I know today, yeah, B2B is a lot of board of people could be a CFO, a CIO, a CTO. And obviously you're going to target one of a one timing and convert them as an issue from the jumping for your product services.</p><p>And that's how things can change. say it slightly sales cycle could be pretty long and things like that, but that's still okay. at least, that, you're doing stuff that people are roadmap. sometimes some of the key metrics like people should track as is not only let's say, B2B is a lot more, Legionnaire people stick with metrics, open rate, click rates and things like that on image.</p><p>Yeah. And nobody focuses on something like, okay. How many of them actually replied back? did you receive a positive set for every email that you sent out? Did you get enough mileage? When did you get something in a routine? that's the kind of conversation that we want to carry out in one of such B2B deals could be several dozen.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:23:45] Yeah, exactly. And like I said, the main bottleneck might not even be on your website, might be email. How do your products, what kind of people do you do your work with? do you have like internal user research front-end development? What are the roles that you regularly interact with? </p><p>Sumantha: [00:24:01] I mean everybody right in starting from research.</p><p>Yeah. There's so many users studies going on, from design teams. So you've got to get in and build, mockups. there's the spark teams, as web product managers, engineers, basically front turn through a stuff the entire, whatever it takes to run a website, good. We technology product marketers. </p><p>Guido: [00:24:27] They're also like, somewhere with an equivalent role, like you a bit focused on the product itself, </p><p>Sumantha: [00:24:34] that's that's right. I think I come in or rather was what's the origin idea of me working for Kaspersky where it's just not only shadow, but what else?</p><p>Carry the spark mentality. And come with what, an approach where, what I think a lot about the users and how they see stuff and how they perceive stuff. And that's what is artists is one of the duties of our product managers is to interact with customers, get to know how they see stuff and fill that gap.</p><p>And in such a way where, detecting could understand our requirements. And basically that is the case where. Know, obviously a CRO team internally is leading this initiative in terms of translating certain requirements where things get simple enough so that it could be quick.</p><p>And it's all about the kind of approach that you take. For example, I'm a big believer in lean principles, lean methodology. that's something where </p><p>Guido: [00:25:29] the skill set is already there. </p><p>Sumantha: [00:25:30] But yeah, , it's the kind of implementation that you have in, and those are the there's a big organization, got like 500 teams internally across different regions.</p><p>and the sheer amount of uplift that we could get from existing traffickers is massive. The opportunities are massive. And given this COVID-19 backdrop, it's really important that, we test and learn. Yeah. it's this highly scope of things that we could actually be, shipping off.</p><p>the intensity, could be a lot more than it's. It's also interesting because you get to work with interesting stuff. Interesting products, both in British, and we'll be in touch some of the best drug, Kaspersky. And you actually come from my understanding or just last year alone. We've probably bagged 900 French across U S Europe, China, Russia.</p><p>when you're backing patrons, that means the product, is pretty good. and we've entered, I think almost 84 independent test assessment. And we were number one in 64 or of them, and at least, top three positions in almost 80% of those tests. So that is something.</p><p>you, your product is a great fit. It's, we've been doing a lot, especially for the medical community. there's this thing where we're entire portfolios of Kaspersky, but free for medical institution is hospitalization. Things are act, and it's, we have the part, And that's something which comes come from Eugene. where do you want to help people out? and or not on the Casper skill or later product inside the secretary alone. He also has this, pension for other startups and things like that for tourism. if you go look up his Instagram account, he's traveled all places.</p><p>And that's where he wants. He wants to foster the culture of startups in zoom in to say that. So when you're at that bar, when you have that ability to do help or the society, why not? </p><p>Guido: [00:27:35] Yeah. That's but that's, I th I think that's very interesting because the skill set that we have as hero can be applied across multiple, aspects of the company.</p><p>Especially, I get that. Yeah. she Rose often, at least first applied in marketing. that makes sense because that's where you usually have the largest numbers yet. If it's on the website, it's your own, it's an owned medium. And that's where the largest part of your, user or, potential user base.</p><p>So you can run experiments there. but if you're a large enough company, you can still apply these same methodologies. to improve the product itself or the service side or email, or </p><p>Sumantha: [00:28:12] absolutely. Absolutely. that's, that's how it should be. if you're an enterprise with a lot of, both what we do see customers, I think we product worth 400 million.</p><p>Guido: [00:28:22] That should be enough traffic to run. They,</p><p>Sumantha: [00:28:29] and we've got like this there's so many stuff that we could do. it's tantalizing, it's time cred. and if he went on business side of things on email lifecycles and things like that, because you could bucket everything out. Okay. what's the welcome sequence that should be right?</p><p>what's the nurturing sequence. What's your conversion sequence? whatever, like I said before, a lot of people are not as much. what's your win back program going to be like. You could literally keep on employing </p><p>Guido: [00:28:57] interesting part. So you, we, you have so much traffic, so it might be like a luxury problem.</p><p>but so how do you &nbsp;prioritization is something that always comes up almost for everyone at every company. So how do you do, how do you decide where you can start working? Because you have you not only have the website, you have so many areas of the business where you have. Enough traffic enough people to do AB testing.</p><p>so w where do you guys decide on what are the big 'cause bottlenecks are in the whole process of the customer journey? </p><p>Sumantha: [00:29:30] Sure. Obviously, we follow our own prioritization. She quenching and people are listening in, could be using something by our eyes shot or any other, production template.</p><p>but it all starts with, you have to measure the kind of metrics that you're after. for example, if you're taking landing pages and things like that, if you ask me. I not only think about, getting fast five users on the site, but I also think about having those customers for five years.</p><p>Think of metrics where, it's, don't think about your CAC, the initial, traction and think that, okay. You're Ross says F as far as the one or something like that, but think about retention and especially in SAS businesses and things that are retention is a big thing.</p><p>What is that you do for. for lifetime tomorrow, what are the aha moments that you feel occurs? in the entire journey or in the entire life cycle marketing of </p><p>Guido: [00:30:21] right. Okay. Like usually about SAS companies, often with e-commerce the focus is really on getting the customer to buy ones because that's easy to measure of course, but in the SAS business, you don't really care about that.</p><p>That first, the first month it's important, but it doesn't bring you all the money. This is not that valuable. If you just look at the monthly </p><p>Sumantha: [00:30:39] subscription, Margaret are focusing on just buy, you're missing out big chunk, And the bigger challenge, which is on under tension.</p><p>And how do you especially see if you're working on learning, which is more on acquisition, how do you prime users so that they continue to go down any right. You've got a number of possibilities, </p><p>Guido: [00:31:03] especially when you have so much data, you can almost start working on. Okay. How can we maybe introduce roadblocks actually, to prevent people to sign up that we already know.</p><p>Okay. To just sign, they're going to sign up for one month and leave. We're not gonna make any money. </p><p>Sumantha: [00:31:20] Absolutely. And on the other side, if you've identified the profitable segment, Or user type or an orange. Yeah, you could also explore further down how have subordinates is in type and, seats.</p><p>You want books, the best you could have personalized. And then the content, which is to speak to them. And that's the whole point, right? You're here to help your end users. You're here to show them what's, uncover, product benefits. For example, it's your time. Yeah, it's, at least in my experience have never then something where I get everything on the platter and show it to the user switch because that's a lot of information, a whole load as well, a content to know that one.</p><p>So it's about understanding, pursue a particular page. if they're experienced users, would this call or two page about to just. understanding the key point or there's a noise user who wants simple explanation as to what the product does. So based on that, based on such a basis, you could actually have a better landing page experience.</p><p>our site-wide experience, your value score could literally go up because you've given them such cues and notions where people could actually understand it and understand, okay. Okay, this makes sense. Okay. I've not thought about this particular question and it's good that the site is, has covered us in an African section.</p><p>Yeah. it's about that. uncovering the journey and actually, having this laid out to them where they understand that, okay, this is how it should be in an ideal world, and this is what I'm getting. it's about, there's always this notion of, perceived price versus perceived cost associated to that.</p><p>and obviously that's where you come in and show them the value for a particular sort of, or product and why they should be using it. And it's not always a yes. Trap. It's not I come to you and say, Hey, do you have a minute or so that I can explain this to you. Yeah. So that's where I understand what's your pain point and ask, What if I did this too, to solve your pain point, would you be interested to know that or, do you think that you should just let that go by? You're like, no, let me know what he's talking about.</p><p>and just change our perception where we bring in the actual one effort, then being more saturated than being, No, just the CEO of sameness right now. How </p><p>Guido: [00:33:48] do you do photography? Are there like any, particular things that you do within, within the company to build on that?</p><p>That's your old culture to get more people on board with. Okay. let's do, experiments and, let's validate stuff instead of just implementing. </p><p>Sumantha: [00:34:04] Yeah, that's a great question. And that's what I think, the industrial team is working on and actually building a sphere of influence and how do we do that?</p><p>We do that by being transparent by showing them, look at the kind of wins that we actually running in your market, and this is what we could actually be doing and also go a step forward and help them understand by. By showing them certain frameworks and things like that. And explain to them that you could actually be doing this.</p><p>Yeah. And it start a notion of every employee contributing. let them start contributing. let your team do the prioritization. </p><p>Guido: [00:34:43] But how are you explaining Ciro to people that are not familiar with it? How do you, what are the tactics that you apply, to convince them, Hey, you should be doing this or let me validate this or however it's arranged, but how do you try to convince them?</p><p>Sumantha: [00:34:57] Yeah, it's more a couple of things could happen. One, if there's an already a believer in the room, Great. We understand that your SROs code and w we should invest behind that. The other thing is there's a non-believer in the room, And that's where it gets interesting.</p><p>And you want to get to a common point like this analogy of me speaking earlier of nodding, yes. to everything. what have you read and how do you get to a common point? for example, if there's a room full of such people. You asked them, do you think you're the most smartest person in the room?</p><p>Yes or no. They might say maybe not the smartest, right? you reached to that common point and that's what data helps in romaine all those assumptions and opinions and all of that. I am not the smartest in the room as well. It's understanding that notion and coming up with hypothesis that actually cleared an impact.</p><p>so that is what you've actually shown to them. That dissolve it in a way. Unfortunate. </p><p>Guido: [00:36:00] I think when I would ask, people, if they think they're smarter than the room, that almost feels like insulting. It's almost indirectly implying that they're stupid.</p><p>Sumantha: [00:36:13] we could, you could change that and ask, who do you consider is the </p><p>Guido: [00:36:17] smartest? </p><p>Sumantha: [00:36:19] And they might say one of the colleague or the manager, it goes upstream or downstream, or whoever is younger, new. And there's a point, from where we could actually start from. And we could, I've used prioritization templates where, you know, including, on the client side, I've let them score hypothesis based on their assumptions, based on their biases and things like that. And collective, we have taken a prioritization score and, gone ahead with. But explain marriage because what do you have to all to understand is that there are certain docs and businesses that I don't understand.</p><p>Yeah. that optical company understands that particular question was head of her department or understanding. And he's going to see that, it has, an opinion and grid stuff. I might have, the greatest test idea and things like that. What if the engineering implementation took like.</p><p>Daniel 14 days, any of you load away a certain men in Virgin and actually show traction. and that's in your hardcore metrics to follow in the grind of uplift and then friendly what you're getting. And obviously you should not shy away from AB testing, step one, what's positive or senators and things like that.</p><p>Your sample size has to, you win. If you hit 99%, each are expensive. There's no harm in doing that for two or three more, which, and adjust just to be pretty damn sure that it's that's what is actually working. You </p><p>Guido: [00:37:45] have, accumulated quite some sort some experience now with, with us to Euro, what is an insight that you think you might have that others that are listening right now might not have what's something that you've figured out and that we can use that we can use it on work.</p><p>Sumantha: [00:38:03] I think, yeah. I think what I've actually figured out as a consultant much before joining Kaspersky was. seeing a trend of similar problems coming up. Great, similar problems that needs to be answered, same set of questions and in same sort of, while it's like someone that we data real time, there's no end world that you could impose.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:38:25] Data.</p><p>Sumantha: [00:38:30] that's where, I saw two aspects to this particular thing where one, I thought, in all these, in all the scratch, the, in this there's always a consultant who could build a product to fix such problems. It's, it could be anything either.</p><p>You. You've super zoom in and build a product or you go out clouds, bundle everything and make product and solve such problems. So that's one insight that I figured out. And on the other hand, in a sense it is almost rudimentary, right? to stand in Delaware, optioning results. It's this is what we had agreed upon.</p><p>and that's it. The engagement is done. Yeah. and our. It's like the same questions, that keeps trying to put coming at you. And there's this notion where at least I've heard that in a consulting could actually come up with an expired deck. There could be active consultants to, doing great stuff, getting prepared greatly as well.</p><p>But I think at some point in time, a lot too. Think about, making money from product. how long could you keep on doing contract and grade? </p><p>Guido: [00:39:40] It's usually a limit that's at least how most work is limited to the hours you can put in. And there's only so much hours a week. </p><p>Sumantha: [00:39:48] and if you, and it's great that you've done that you've observed companies at close quarters and you might come up with certain, product ideas and actually build it.</p><p>And that's when you make your money. </p><p>Guido: [00:40:01] That's nice though. That's what we all want. what are the, and making money while sleeping? what are the things you want to improve or change, in the coming 12 months? What are the things you were working on? The projects that you are excited about? </p><p>Sumantha: [00:40:15] there's, this, there's a lot of exciting stuff happening at Kaspersky,</p><p>but, in general, Yeah, in general, w where Hellbound on unimportant user experience. Oh, there's a lot of stuff which we're actually doing in a good, you could just imagine the kind of sheer amount of work that we're doing, like two hours of work, which has being shipped in six months.</p><p>So there's a lot of testing with just coming in this is a lot of Velasquez and it's, that's great for any organization, right? Because if somebody is, in a partner up and is jumping with energy that's French. In every, each and every organization within that strata, that energy spreads.</p><p>And that's where I see Kaspersky at, the sheer number of projects, the number of tests that we're doing, the number of, impact and results that we're seeing the testing impact and all of that it's fed that, great page and then things are slowly ongoing. we're actually explaining and.</p><p>And, taking that to different package or telling what different insights and that leads to, new set of hypothesis, new sets of testing. And that's how it is. This is always progress. And as long as it does progress, it's better than perfection, right? We're just going out, getting things done.</p><p>and there's this positive </p><p>Guido: [00:41:34] we're optimizers. So we also like to optimize the way we optimize. So it is it's very much. Yeah. Thank you so much for sharing all your thoughts, about this in the podcast. like I said, in the beginning, you've been listening to a couple of episodes, yourself too.</p><p>So who do you think I should be asking on the show? Who do you want to listen to? </p><p>Sumantha: [00:41:58] I think, I've been, bye I'll check out Dynarski or the guidelines or good guy.org is who's the editor in chief. and, I think I'm not sure if he's doing an episode before, that guy keeps on testing a lot.</p><p>there's so many stuff that we've been doing on goodyear.org. I think which, which would be a nice addition. </p><p>Guido: [00:42:18] For the people that don't know the website, he basically, monitors a lot of those, the bigger websites like booking, bull, Netflix, those are things that regularly come up and he basically monitors them, for changes on the websites.</p><p>and that's, they're running and sharing those results with us. </p><p>Sumantha: [00:42:36] it's more on his, he's also a gung-ho bird or repeatability of winning tests across segments. and this has got a big data repository of such stash. I think he'll be a wonderful addition and, being tight-lipped on Kaspersky.</p><p>So maybe our VP of digital &nbsp;next time when it does, there's a bit of relaxation and then software. Very good. No, maybe literally walking into a run on the kind of stuff we've been doing, hopefully </p><p>Guido: [00:43:04] sure. you can introduce me to Ivan, right? Yeah, for sure. Thanks. And, as a final question for you and any Shiro related books that you'd like to take to our audience, what did you enjoy reading lately?</p><p>Sumantha: [00:43:20] one of the best absolute, gold standards, at least in my, ISIS is dr. Flint. McGlaughlin, he's got Mac labs, marketing, SharePoint, and a bunch of, courses as well on landing page optimization or non online testing. And all of that, he's written this great book, which is called us, marketers as a philosopher.</p><p>and there's a great of bunch, good stuff on, in terms of his qualified, how convergent sequence would come out to be. He's got a formula for conversion. So to speak 30 yard, years of marketing research, he, it goes something like this. She used to go to forum plus three plus two, all of minus F minus to it.</p><p>There you go. &nbsp;</p><p>Guido: [00:44:06] yeah, that's it. We don't need those. A number of courses or education. It's just simple as that. </p><p>Sumantha: [00:44:11] We reading the formula. . it's simple and very performed, right? and this, the C stands for obviously the conversion sequence or the M in that Stanford motivation V in that stands for the force of value proposition.</p><p>I send for incentives, you have Stanford fiction elements present on the site and a as anxiety and image. So obviously, these are all the kinds of tourist techs that come into picture and his she's just given a magnitude four for each of those. if you're highly motivated, even if the a hundred hurdles you went across all of them, but then, and that's where magnitude of motivation is the highest, which is for them next comes to force of value proposition, which is three weeks, right?</p><p>the next biggest, an entity with the money to do it. It's of course a value proposition is that high. then obviously you're going to go ahead similarly for incentives, for friction and an exert element and for remote anxiety elements, which is minus two and in the form, then that's great.</p><p>good for users. Good for the site because you've not induced anxiety or are biosimilars, for example, you bought a product and you're anxious that, okay. You've not made it made the right decision. So things like that. So Hasbrook is a great grid, which is, doulas as a philosopher, he goes a lot of </p><p>Guido: [00:45:32] good stuff.</p><p>Yeah, </p><p>Sumantha: [00:45:34] I'm on bio-psychology on how you actually, do things. Yeah. So that's there and there's so many books, right?</p><p>Guido: [00:45:48] we have a, I'm collecting a list of books, that's a Ciro's, basically it all recommends, there are so many marketing books, but he wrote cafes slash books. I'm trying to collect, all of the books that are, guests, recommends. but </p><p>Sumantha: [00:46:01] I'm sure. I'm sure some of these might or might have popped balloon.</p><p>Guido: [00:46:07] This one hasn't been in there. Yeah. So I'll definitely add that to the lesson for people that want to read more about this, the conversion formula for M plus three V plus two. Times one minus F minus two a, that might be a bit </p><p>Sumantha: [00:46:21] abstract for this, but there </p><p>Guido: [00:46:22] will be more, information about that's, in the show notes.</p><p>If you want to read about that, someone has thank you so much for sharing all this information. with us and sharing your story, starting with, evaluating movies. I think that's a background I hadn't heard before. I think that's a great, great backgrounds for our forest.</p><p>Zero a specialist. thank you so much.</p><p>‍</p>",,

All the major pitfalls. He came across while running CRO projects at the, his, the Spanish web agency that he founded back in 2013. My name is Nikita. Yonson welcome to she. Rock fate. The award meaningful podcast, where I show you the behind the scenes of optimization teams and talk with their specialists about data and human driven optimization.</p><p>My goal with this &nbsp;spreading mindset of experimentation and validation and to improve quality standards in digital marketing, you can be an enormous reaching this goal by sharing this episode or any other episode with your colleagues. And if you're not subscribed yet, make sure you are by checking this in your podcast.</p><p>It really means a lot to me. So thank you for doing that. In case you missed a previous episode.

SiteSpect an online dialogue. Welcome to season two, episode 40. Ricardo. Thanks so much for joining me on the show. And, yeah, like with all my guests, I'd love to start with getting to know you a bit more. So let's get started with how you got involved with zero. Oh, </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:01:58] first of all, thank you so much for having me here.</p><p>And, how this thing has started. Let me think. I think it was. 2022 or 23 years ago while I was studying Los in the university. And I discovered the internet, in the late nineties. Yeah. so I really was involved in some artistic stuff like Darwin. Or playing with Photoshop, all this kind of stuff.</p><p>And I discover the, I can be one person that makes websites, So I started making websites for free at the reunion. And then I discovered that some people thought that was a good idea to pay me for it. so I move into the business and I started working, doing this kind of a stop in my first year.</p><p>My first reason God, I think I was with master, the guy that does everything around a website. So that's how I started. and I moved in my next movement. I moved through UX and analytics. I'm finally into business and that's how I have the. The whole, the whole thing, the analytics, the UX bar on the business part that makes, the CRO makes sense.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:09] And so you currently own the car or the company flats? one-on-one </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:03:13] yeah, that's my company. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:15] So what do you guys do? Not only is hero, right? </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:03:19] No. I always say that we are a company with the, with seven years in the market, we were born in 2013. And I always say that we face two kind of different challenges.</p><p>The first one is when a company comes to us and wants to out the retail experience. So focused on commercial, e-commerce, user flows, lead generation on this kind of stuff we don't do. And we don't work for social media branding on this kind of stuff. This is the first challenge people that wants to be barely read a very good digital experience for combating and the yellow.</p><p>And the other kind of projects is when. Some companies comes with DHL or the consensus or the it's all products and they are not working the way they shop. So they say, Hey, I have here a problem. I don't know where is the problem? So please call me to fix all this stuff and let's make it work. sometimes it's only comas sometimes it's media.</p><p>Yeah. Italy. It doesn't matter, but they are not, achieving the goals they have for the needs of the business. And that's why they come to us. These are the two kind of products will work. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:33] How has your business, or maybe even your client base, how was it impacted by, basically 20, 20?</p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:04:39] here we are in a Spain. So you know that the Spain has a very, hard situation, across the pandemic. Of course, I think we are lucky because. All of our clients are a Steeler clients. we, we don't have any laws, but the problem is that the conditions of your work have changed a lot, in terms, in negotiation, in all these parts of your relation with your clients.</p><p>But to me, to be honest, in this last month, just facing, 20, 21. We are receiving now lot of, RCPs, requesters, all this kind of stuff, because I think that here now, every company has a very clear mission that really needs to be in a detailed scenario. they really need not only need to be there, but also to be in a very good way, because if you want to be competitive right now, It's not enough.</p><p>Yes. Having any comas or there's not enough, that's having a website or an application. You really need to be really good at what you do. Because if we take a look at the other data we have about combustion rates, incomes, all this kind of stuff. People who really care two or three years ago of building very good digital products or very good digital services.</p><p>They are, they are achieving a very, a high increase in their business of yet it's in the data. So it's a little bit complicated. You have to be in a mindset that allows you to balance, because now I have some information, maybe in two days I have a completely different information, so I have to adapt.</p><p>But the best part of this situation is that almost every company, almost every individual. Now it's very focused on the internet and on the being the detail scenario in a very good way. So that's something in this theory. That's something good for us here in Spain is that we have almost a quarter of own companies.</p><p>Serious risk of disappearing or with city of risk of very hard financial injuries. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:54] It's hard for those people that cannot move that fast, Or the companies that cannot move that fast towards digital. But yeah, it sounds very familiar. That's part of the businesses that are, those were already, in online.</p><p>they are flying now and they double or even triple or even more, times their revenue. There are also companies that struggle even when there were a online, but if there are in a business that was typically about doing face to face business, like meeting spaces or doing of course as a whole, The food sector or restaurants, it's a very difficult.</p><p>but there are in general, I think there are a lot of opportunities for our business being in digital commerce. The securize as a whole has grown a lot the last couple of years. </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:07:38] Yeah, I think so. Our problem is that most of the economy of a sprain it's based on tourists. so that's very hard for a lot of companies here to handle, because it's a very hard situation because we don't have tourists right now.</p><p>Yeah, exactly. so almost 20% of our whole economy, it's a it's depended on tourists. So that's a big hit. That's not so nice right now. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:01] So do you also see then a, company's focusing more on doing business across the borders because they did want to get </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:08:06] the business from somewhere else or?</p><p>Yes, but I think this is something that comes, for the last years maybe. a Spain is. Typically exporting professionals. a lot of people that is good here, finally, works abroad in other country in Europe or anywhere in America or in Asia. But now a lot of people is moving to digital and also, it's very focused on, partnerships with all the companies, eh, outside and announce something curious because in the last, in the last weeks, There have been, several companies outside of Spain that have bought companies from Spain.</p><p>The last one was a . I think it was a serious venture capital company that has out, they, the main. In terms of total, we have here about renting, I think, houses or selling houses that it's called the daily stuff. it was about two weeks ago by a Swedish venture capital a chain. So yes. Now it's it's now it's like everybody is trying to do different things in order to achieve different goals.</p><p>And I think that's a, that's weird part. Of course, the companies that has a very classical mindset, They are going to suffer a lot in this time, but not only in his fame. Yeah. white </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:24] SiteSpect offers a worldwide unique AB testing, personalization and product recommendation solution.</p><p>Sites paperworks and service sites without any tags or scripts, which guarantees an ultimate performance, the SiteSpect solution eliminates delays and the chance of any flickering effects. And this approach also ensures that the current and future browser structure rules like ITP and ETP don't make an impact </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:09:47] on your AB testing and </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:48] personalization for more info visit.</p><p>That's cool. During this time you thought let's publish another book because it's your second book, right on Sierra that you, that you publish. So what are these about </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:10:07] the. The story behind this the last week is the last time I was in Madrid before the lockdown, before the national outcome. The last time I was in my day, it was 4% in the book I need was a date.</p><p>And it was a day that things we're completely insane about the Coby down. so it was expected to be. A 200 people event. I'm finally we were, I think Phil to your or 40, that was my last three. And, and this is the second one. So please don't look at the cover. And this is the second one.</p><p>this is called in English. it's a professional CRO. That's strategic, some tactics to boost, you'll do your child product conversion. And this is the first one that was two years ago that it's just called, CRO, the sign up development of the child business. Okay. so now is the second one is just a.</p><p>Is that some book, but for writing an advanced Smoot, I need that the step before you don't understand before was two years ago when I published the first one is just a book about basics. And when you have a, it works really well much more than the than I expected. And also the company that &nbsp;expected.</p><p>And now, we focus on being just more professional. Yes. talking about to how to work with a SBA, with single pitch applications, how to, how to develop your own CLO Mitchell only knowing that which ones are working now in the market, how to work with the telematics in the quantitative and qualitative way, which are the main roles and functions.</p><p>So fussy, CRO lead, all this kind of stuff. Yeah. so there's one is much more advanced, it's in the market and it's working. Nice besides of a &nbsp;situation. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:58] Exactly. and that's of course, why I wanted to talk to you because the, currently the books are in Spanish only. Are there any plans for publishing it in English?</p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:12:05] but I think by I that in English you have. Tons of things to read about CRO. Maybe there are not so much books about the specific CRO, because of course you can find years ago you have always be testing or all this kind of stuff. That it's very good. But the problem in my, not only my country, also in America and other countries, is that.</p><p>We don't have any kind of material in Spanish, So we always have to read in English. We always have to translate. That's why this company totally total with me. Hey, do you want to write a book about chiro in Spanish? But I think there are no plans to publish in English, but we as a company and me as an author, yes, we are polishing some things in English.</p><p>she may. We publish in our website, complete a study of almost 150 pages, maybe in English about how come it was changing the detail. So business here in Spain. Yeah. Completely full with data about commercial rates. What kind of revenue each company's having, depending on the kind of business that they are running, all this kind of stuff.</p><p>So we need a. Set off. I think it was 600 interviews with people just to identify how they behavior has, is changing in Spain. And you have it in Spanish and you have it also in English. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:30] Yeah. I saw it on your website. So it's still available. So people can still download that. So we can link to that in the show notes.</p><p>But I still wanted to talk to you about the book because not everyone obviously speaks Spanish or this podcast is perfect for you to explain what your book is about. It's through an English audience does as a short summary, and, of course, as a motivation for people to start learning Spanish, </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:13:54] Thank you.</p><p>Thank you. it's a good, it's a good idea to start speaking in Spanish reading this book. It's yeah. Yeah, but they won't teach you how to ask for a bill or for food, but you will know a lot of </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:08] Sierra that's of course it's a secondary through our Shiro work.</p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:14:15] it was a hard challenge because, when they say to me, Can you write this work? the first thing that comes to my mind was okay, who's the reader of this book. who's the people who's going to read this book. So the first one is completely oriented to people that really don't know so much about TRO is people that used us investigating.</p><p>They know. It exist, but they don't really know what it is or how it can be used in a company. And the second one is just focus on the professionals and people that is working. In my niche, our marketing, they really want to move to CRO or people that is just beginning with CRO. So I started what I think is the core thing in that it's methodology you cannot do that never cannot, leave the responsibility of a project to the talent of only one person.</p><p>So you really need a system. So you need a system and you really need to build your own system because not all business models work the same. So things that work for you, if you are in retailing or you are selling, I don't know, a full, short bets. They can work, but they, they will work if you are working for an insurance company or a bank.</p><p>so I'm moving to meta-level years as a key aspect of the CRO. So I started talking about them at all. Is that now we have, of course CXL has their metal knee also. Why wider? Fano all this kind of stuff. So I talk about them and then I talk about the mental. Literally I've been building in the last.</p><p>10 years. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:52] So can you take us through that a bit? So for example, if you encounter a new client, with an average kind of, budget that you see out there, how do you approach it? How do you start building, that's on that methodology? </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:16:05] I think a very important thing is just the, eh, Not only the budget, also the kind of digital maturity the organization has.</p><p>So this is something I specifically write and put into our framework. This is something for me. It's something critical. You really need to know if you are working with a client that has a high level of the term maturity or a low one. Because in the high one, of course we talk about tools like content square, or maybe what now it's content square, or Tealeaf, or this kind of stuff.</p><p>And you are working at unsure. You will work with them, data scientists, a lot of, probably seeking metals. That's right. Yeah. But if you are working with a low maturity, we are talking about detail. if you are working with. No, it's our maternity company. You have to do more simple things. you have to be like a teacher, so you have to start with simple things and let them understand that simple movements.</p><p>Can allow us to achieve important goals and then move across more difficult ones. You know what I mean? so I define three kinds of companies, the most mature one that has a specific teams. There's a lot of budget. A lot of tunes are very complex, a stack. No very complex, a stack of technology and people.</p><p>The intermediate one is that it's typically, it's a company that it's running business in detail for the last three or four years. Things are growing. Things are growing. Okay. And they want to do the next step. They want to be more professional. So they have some boundaries and you are the one that it's going to help them to break those rumblings, because they don't have enough knowledge.</p><p>They don't know what kind of technology they have to choose, or they don't know how to play with &nbsp;or with. All kind of stuff. And you have the basic ones, the companies that really don't have a resources in CRO, but they want to boost their results. So you have to start working in what I call the genic part.</p><p>you have to have all your basics very well done. So please don't focus on the. Chatbots or in artificial intelligence, don't focus on that. If your information architecture doesn't allow people to find a product. so we work in those three levels. It's same methodology, two alpha steps, but three kind of three types.</p><p>About three times, depending on the company, in order to be able to make your war thing. Each in each company </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:49] marketing budgets have suffered and the sheriff for AB testing has been impacted too. If you want to keep that thing to enterprise standards, but save 80% on your annual contract, you can consider comfort.</p><p>But are some summer release you can take advantage of full stack and hybrid features, strong privacy compliance, no blink and enterprise. Great </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:19:11] security. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:13] Feel good about </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:19:14] your </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:14] smart business position in infest. What you save back in your CRO program. Check out www adults over slash 2020. Let's for example things a, the middle of wonder intermediate, one.</p><p>So how would you start there? How do you start implementing better zero practices there? </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:19:33] Okay. We always do. the first step for us is it's an inception. So we really need to understand the business model of each company because alpha. Two companies seem to be very similar. They never are so similar.</p><p>so that's why you really need to understand the business mode. So to understand business model, you really need to know. Which is the, which is a client of that company, which is a client. And of course, please show me your data. I need to understand your reasons, but of course, I really need, to see and to understand your data, how implementation has been done.</p><p>Watch what kind of KPIs or metrics are you measuring and why, which is your historic as a detail business? How well are the results two years ago? Three years ago, whether we want to move, then it's you. And then please tell me about your technological stuff, which is OCMs, which you are sharing. Do you have any plans to move to all the CMS?</p><p>What other technologies are you using day by day? I don't know, like Salesforce or like mating, which is zero marketing automation on tunes. How you, how do you plan your detail analysis? What kind of factions do you do? this kind of stuff is for us is critical in the first part, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:52] sorry to where to start.</p><p>those are a lot of things that you can, then you can start working on a assuming they don't give you a limited budget. you have to start, you have to start somewhere. </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:21:05] We have the first step is we do an audit. So depending on the sector of the company, we have like a checklist.</p><p>so we always see if some things are running properly or not, it's like a check. So we check almost 150, 170 things, depending on the type of business you are working for. So we do this check and if we find a lot of pitfalls or a lot of problems, then we most to, Or they're in a backlog from the most important thing because it's surgeon and it's important.</p><p>I'm the least one. And then we moved into, let's propose what kind of things we can do to fix this. And then we build a backlog and then we start the conversation with our client, or you always say, That we don't work for our clients that we work with our clients. I think that CRO is not possible.</p><p>If you have the, you don't have the confidence. And if you don't have a very good relation with your client, because you really need to understand the business. I think that's </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:22:13] key part. We talk about Shiro obviously. but do you also, usually are the person that can implement those kind of things on your website?</p><p>Are you also the web developer for those? </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:22:23] Yes, we, I know that a lot of people. Don't do that kind of stuff. But I think we decide maybe in the arena, seven years ago that we will be a full stack company. so we do both parts also. Yeah. Also implementation on the technical part. Yeah. So we are imbalanced with several companies, have tools like content square, or like a Google optimize or target or this kind of stuff.</p><p>And we do the strategic part. it's more conceptual and more related with UX UI, all this kind of things, but also the. The technical part. I think that's important because depending on their maturity, you cannot, some companies are not able to do things if you are not able to do that for them.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:09] If you look across your, your client portfolio, what would you say for when you come to new clients? what were the most common problems that they have the most common challenges that they have, with, with zero </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:23:20] or. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:21] The growth in general? I think, </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:23:24] a lot of stuff, a lot of them, but I think that there are very typical ones and this is worldwide.</p><p>the first one right now for me, it's how people try to adapt the digital experience to Mobike. here, there are still, there are a lot of pitfalls because mobile navigation is very complex. You can use an iPhone of course, but also you can use a very, Simple device that has not so much the couple of LEDs as an iPhone.</p><p>Yep. So the first pitfall is that it's how my wireless performing very poor performance in general, the reboot performance. And that's why, because companies don't make that seltzer, a question. Yeah, that is, Hey, this is my digital experience in desktop, but I also have to think that. How is my digital experience for my wife, because probably is the same guy as the same people, digital experiences, but it's not being the same context and know the same needs and not the same processes.</p><p>And of course, now I hearing that say, I have my credit card. I have my books. I have fabric theme by the fan. If I'm using my wife, probably my context is completely different. Of course I can be at home. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:36] Exactly. And usually the people that work on the website, they use their desktop screen. Which makes sense if you work on the website, but then you completely miss the whole mobile app. </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:24:45] Yeah. I think the companies has to start thinking not desktop or mobile, they have to start thinking in detail experiences. And that also means that you have to understand that your client, of course, is visiting your website or even using your applications, but also is going to your source.</p><p>And also just talking with people that it's inside the stores and also reading about you in the newspaper and also it's reading your own media or your own, arts. So now this is a very huge challenge because a lot of companies, each our marketing is something like a war apart, and it's not inside the whole business.</p><p>So people that it's achieving goals is there is the ones that are understanding that it's only one experience. So you have to focus on the kind of, if you want to build for your clients and all the typical one, it's about checkout. Everybody's focusing in today and take out this failing.</p><p>I have this medium souls about traffic that is not working properly in checkout. I have this kind of device and it's not working properly in checkout. and of course, checkout problems are very related with technology. And how you are monitoring it to work the right way in different devices or in different orangy prime channels.</p><p>And one thing that really, I think it's a nightmare. and I hate because I don't understand how can I see these things in 2020? It's about the search experience. When you are trying to find a product inside our retailer or any kind of eCommerce and you are using, the search box, there are a lot of very poor experiences about certain products or certain things using the phone.</p><p>For me, it's something very important because if I cannot find a product. How am I going to buy it? So products, the first section is the most important one. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:26:36] Yeah. And often it's already poor on desktop that alone. </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:26:40] That's I think typical mistake here. It's about tipo squatting. I'm misspelling. we've been working, last year in a lot of steam in fashion.</p><p>So it's very funny when you see that people is just trying to find products and they don't know the name, they guess they know the name, but they don't know how to write it. For example, if you are looking for something like the expression, high waist, hearing a Spain, a young people say, Hey, I want my trousers in high waist, but you know how to say high waist?</p><p>But you don't know how to write it. So when you are a Spanish guy and you are trying to look for highways, trousers, they really don't know how to write high waist. So every, a lot of misspellings, a lot of people squatting. So what the search engine does for them zero results and probably you have 100 or 200 trousers with high waist.</p><p>This is just an example, but it happens a lot of times, a lot of times. And if I cannot find a product I'm not going to for over </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:27:42] 10 years now, all my dial-up advisors about evidence-based conversion optimization with a focus on data and psychology. We see that analyzing data and recognizing customer behavior results in a better online dialogue with your clients.</p><p>In a higher ROI that team of strategists, analysts, psychologist, and UX specialists gathered valuable insights in your online behavior of your visitors. And together with you optimize the different elements of your zero program through redesigned expert reviews, AB test and behavioral analysis. For more information about their services, go to Oman dialogue.</p><p>Usually the. The search queries on your own website, that's usually a treasure trove for four seasons. </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:28:25] Yes, but they are, but you have to track them. And of course you have to take a look on them because of you are tracking them and you never look for that data. But, I really love that field of work, about information architecture and navigation parts.</p><p>And of course, So it's acquaintance because in our experience, it's a very important point to work on. That's a mirror. if let's think of it, 100% of the people is see in the search box on a lot of people is very, it's very comfortable using that because we are very used to use Google or other kinds of search engines.</p><p>So it's our natural behavior right now. So please just leave them a very normal experience when they are searching for something, because if five is be fine looking for something, and you tell me that you have zero results, I will move to your company. Or, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:19] yeah, I think when my, girlfriend is shopping on mobile for anything related to clothing for our little kids, I think that the first thing she looks for on any website is just the search box.</p><p>She doesn't even try the main menu or something. Just go through the search box. cause it's, it feels like that's the fastest way to figure out are they actually providing what I'm looking for </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:29:41] and that's the first transaction. And if you are not able to solve the first transaction, what about the rest?</p><p>Probably they don't mean, so that's a very typical pitfall and it's very, very European to solve. And now we have a lot of technology. to make, to experience something really good. But the main problem is that a lot of companies implement the eCommerce CMS, like Magento, like up or newcomers, and they are using the changes that comes with our CNS.</p><p>They only work with, specific docs. Yep. So if you don't right, exactly. The right word, my result will be zero. so we have a big problem here, and that's something that you have to focus on solving because it's a very important part of any combustion process, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:28] that people are used to using search.</p><p>Brookshire's so much these days with, with Google and Google always has a result. And, you always, will find at least something. so the assumption I think is also if there is no result, they probably don't have it, even if I misspell it. And I do that only eCommerce store. If I misspell something in Google, I still got reachable.</p><p>So I get suggestions, whatever there will be results, whatever I type in. And if you expect that same in an eCommerce store, just type in anything, and there was no results. People don't bother going through menu, going back, trying different, all kinds of different things if they don't believe anymore that you even have the </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:31:04] yeah.</p><p>Completely. That's a that's, but it's something very important. And sometimes in some syrup or yes, people is focusing on checkout. Yeah. A please. Yes. take a custom back because your problem is not in your checkout, your problem. I'm looking for something and I cannot find it. So that's a real problem.</p><p>I always try to too, to be clear with my clients. And I always say the same as Tori is this is like you find going inside a store. And I ask, to some people that is working there, I please, where can I find this product? And they don't say anything to me. That's what they are doing. Exactly.</p><p>I'm not saying here is not the place. Please go out. No, you are saying nothing </p><p>very rude, but it's true. It's other what they are doing. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:31:53] Yeah, exactly. Hey, you just, choral mints, you got your side. Okay. people, at the intermediate or the lower level, they. Maybe they know the tools, they play around with it, but I don't exactly know to do.</p><p>Or the example you just mentioned that people focus too much on one part of the customer journey, like checkout and don't look at the other things. So how do you approach this when you encounter this at a, at those companies, how do you. How do you train those people, and embed that zero mindset that the company, </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:32:22] I always have to face the question that it's very typical.</p><p>It's very hard because they always ask what kind of, what amount. Of money or what kind of performance am I going to win? Or am I going to aim? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:32:38] Sounds very familiar. Yeah. </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:32:39] Yeah. and I always say, yeah, I cannot promise you anything because I really don't know. So what I can promise you is that we are going to use a mixology in order to teach some goals.</p><p>But I don't know what measure, I don't know if we will perform. So 2% better, 5%, 80%. I really don't know. We always, eh, we always start losing weight. So if we have an, a previous approach in the section and we have our previous analysis, we always find 15, 20, 25 peoples something that has to be solved.</p><p>Some of them because we found some interesting pitfalls talking about UX or usability. And sometimes because we find some pitfalls, just taking a look, a deeper look into each one analytics. So we always propose a roadmap and a first roadmap. So this is the things that we are going to do. And this is the order.</p><p>Being that we are going to do. So please let us know if you agree with us or not, because maybe the, what I think is the most important thing for you. You can say, Hey, you are putting this in the first place. And for me, it's the fourth or the fif, because in business, I need all the things before. So we always start with this of 20, 25 things that we have.</p><p>We find we have to fix most of the comes from UX. Eristics. Or, or not general best practices, but best practices specific to business, best practices, So this is how we start. Sometimes we move into testing sometimes. Now, if this is something that is a risk taker, this that you expect for this related to UI, eh, we move directly into a fix.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:34:31] That's how you work, but how do you. And get your clients on the level that they can do to work themselves, or at least get a better understanding of what you are doing. how do you train your clients? </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:34:42] No, I don't know your experience with, for us sec, because we don't have to train because people come with the idea of, I want to improve my performance.</p><p>Yeah. and some people. Have told me about you. so we really don't have to train people so much because they really have a very good expectation about what they can expect. and also, and I have to be very honest here, and also we sometimes, you don't want to work. With some kind of clients, if you are expecting results in two or three months, we are not the company you need to work with.</p><p>if you are always with the word urgent or with a word tomorrow in your mouth, maybe we are not the best company for you. Because business results don't come in 24 hours. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:35:33] Now, if you want the results in 24 hours, you just need to spend a lot of put all your money on AdWords and traffic and then, just fingers crossed hope for the best.</p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:35:42] Yes. I'm sure you have a listen about this a lot of times, but I. Muster combustion problems wants to be solved with topic. Yeah. and that's not the way. Nope. If you want to sell more, of course the first thing you can do is just to spend more. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:35:57] But that's what a lot of companies do, right?</p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:35:59] Yeah. That's why I love them. And now this is something that is about, improving your. Performance. so you have to have a look on the strategic part of it and also in the tactics. One of course, but, I really don't have to train so much my clients right now because, I think we started when we started.</p><p>Yes, we have to do that. But now it's not the case because most of the people comes because they have some references about our work or they know people that has been working with us in the last years. And, they come with a very good expectation for our side and. As I told you when we hear some clues that this is a very toxic client for us.</p><p>We don't want to go into the project </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:36:47] if you need to train people. Of course. That's easy. Go read that first. </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:36:51] Yeah, I think that it's a very, I want to be so honest, so it's a very, nice commercial action to write a book. You don't do it for money? No, because you are not going to our money. there are people who are writing books are the people who's writing novels, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:37:10] you write 20 novels, then you start making money.</p><p>I guess </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:37:13] I'm just wanting to, but with this kind of a staff, You're really come to be someone confidence for a lot of people. And of course they read your book and some of them, not all, but some of them, of course also we'll have some haters, but about sure. Some of them will call you. You can say, Hey, I have read your book.</p><p>And I think this is very useful for my company. So that's why I tell you that we don't have to train people because they come train it, And also that was very important. Yeah. In the books from the beginning, I'm only writing about poets. I've been working. I'm not writing about the NASA or not writing about Apple or I'm not writing about Amazon because I've never worked before for any of those three, maybe one day, but not today.</p><p>So I'm only writing about poets that we've been working for in the last year. And I think that's very useful because this is not. About, Hey, take a look about what Amazon did. Amen. You've never been working in Amazon. How do you know that? Because you've been reading a lot of blog posts. It's the same thing that anyone can do.</p><p>so we are only talking from experience and I think that's the most important thing we can </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:38:25] do. </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:38:26] Yesterday's brainstorm was so good. I really liked step's idea of running that test on the call to action buttons, making them orange will really make them stand out. Don't you think? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:38:37] Yeah. Do you want to design real AB test winners and achieve enormous conversion uplifts, then stop, brainstorming and take a scientific approach. If you can read Dutch, follow the steps, then online influence many even book Delta now and ruling in the authors course and become an expert in applying proven behavioral signs yourself, go to &nbsp;dot com for more information and free donuts.</p><p>speaking of that experience, I would love to know. So you have the business now for seven years. Yes. And you've done, digital for longer than that. What were your biggest fuck-ups or your biggest assumptions that you have maybe about the clients? Where did he say shit? If I had known that seven or 10 years ago that he might have life much easier, what is it?</p><p>What are the things that went wrong? </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:39:24] I think that something that is very hard to learn and as fast as you learn it, as Whistler for you is in what kind of clients you never have to work. You never have to work because it's one of us. Sure. It's very good doing somethings and some clients and some people it's really, to pay for it and they will be happy with your services.</p><p>But you really need to know as soon as possible. Who is your real target? Not everyone, because I think one of my main mistakes as anyone that starts running a business is a, I need clients. So I need clients now. So anyone? Yeah, anyone is good for me. You have money. You are going to pay me. You're a very good client for me and that's not true.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:40:10] What made you, what make you a better selector of clients? </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:40:13] I started reading a book. One of my partners to me, and it's called the undisciplined purchase of less, the alpha is of my count. And it's a book about saying, no, it's a book, it's a book about, Hey, you don't have to say yes to everything.</p><p>so you also have to learn how to say no to your clients. And it was very useful for me because in the beginning we'd have some problems. Because we were working with people that was very happy with our services and with people that was very hungry and to say, Hey, this is not what's going wrong for you.</p><p>yeah. So in across the years I identify several things that for me, it's like an alarm ringing, So you don't want the first one. It's about lack. Of briefing, So your only briefing is that somebody is writing to you and say, Hey, I want to improve my performance. That's all you briefing.</p><p>Yeah. Hey, if you don't have the time nine to look inside your business, to know you're around business, to know what it's going wrong and you don't take a, you don't want to take the time to explain me the right way. But what do you expect from me? That's a very bad side note. You're the one it's about time, so want to improve, but I want to improve next month or I want to improve tomorrow or I want to improve in two weeks.</p><p>that's not real. The other one is budget. So some people are saying, Hey, I want to sell. 1 million euros next year, this year I'm selling 100,000, but I have the same resources on the same budget for everything. So this is a little difficult, and this is something more subjective, but it's also about feeling.</p><p>This is our work based on relations. So you really need to have a good relation with your client. And if you don't have that feeling or is not other, would I be at work together and the other one it's, it's cool. Who is writing you or proposing you some kind of partnership. they say, Hey, if you improve my business this way, I will leave you 20% of my business.</p><p>So I always say, Hey, I will never give you. Part of my business if I believe in it never. so So I think this things are typical hours. Are we, that we always, taken the first steps, but it's very important to learn how to fix them, as soon as you can. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:42:41] So the red flags are a short, shorter, no briefing, a short time span or expectancy of, of results.</p><p>The budget itself. And if they offer a partnership just run. </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:42:55] yes. I'm also the kind of, the kind of relationship you have to the first conversation, and this is, I think that. Those are the main red flags for me. Yeah. I always say that I'm not your best option. Sure. In the market, you have options that fits your needs and the sandbox.</p><p>In my case, I, for me, it's really hard to understand that you don't take five single minutes to explain to me how is your business and how it goes. That's the line, Yes. Exactly. So for me, that's a very hardcore </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:43:27] and, even outside of your , even outside of these, these, points, do you already have a feeling about the business, whether it's a good client or not based on the vertical they're in the business that they're in?</p><p>if it maybe. B2B obesity is very generic, but do you already see, okay, this is B2B. They are doing a dishwashers. they're doing it this way. Day of during a service company. what are red flags or, maybe even positive signs. just based on the business model for four years, zero work.</p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:43:57] here we have a very ethical part of the company, so we don't work for some kind of business. So we don't work for the sexual industry. Yeah. For example, we don't like to work or we don't work in gambling or we don't work in what I call in a Spanish. I don't know the word in English, the pyramid, all this tractor pyramid game.</p><p>Yeah. Yeah, so we don't, but this is something about the company called the co the company culture. So we don't feel comfortable with, for four years, the way we thought or are ethical about B2B or B to C or this Wasser's iOS say that maybe we are now working with a company that design build opens on.</p><p>They sell it worldwide. it's a </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:44:50] business for, for pizza. </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:44:53] It's like a, it's like the kind of old ones that they use in the hospitals, jails schools, all these kinds of very big opens. And you can, that you can manage to make food for. 500 people or 2000, and they are selling it on the, and they are selling it across the internet.</p><p>I think there are no real boundaries. The problem is that it's much more about the expectations you have. If you have never been selling an open online, you cannot be in the point that say in the next year I will sell 1 million over. Yes. Okay. What amount of falling South you sold this year?</p><p>Zero. So you want to move from zero to 1 million? Just like a miracle, so something that's not going to happen, but I really like to be in both in industries where I've never been before. So this is the thing that I really love about my job that I, have had the chance of learning about a lot of business models, business to business, to consumer administration, to administration, a lot of them, but I think that now.</p><p>We have the chance to improve any kind I'm completely Truett, any kind of business in India. Absolutely. Any kind, there are no boundaries right now. And I think that people are, it's a building, some technical stuff, some technical, some of the strengths in their regards can sell it across the world if things are done the proper way.</p><p>And with the time I think the problem was the same. It's about time. And resources and part of the resources she's time. Things are not going to happen fast. Because we want it to happen fast. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:46:35] Exactly. </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:46:36] everything it's time, your baby needs nine months. It's not going to be born in five months out.</p><p>So you want it, But it's a balance. This is very typical mindset that some companies have. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:46:47] Yeah. He, you cannot always move things faster just to throw more by throwing more money or more people </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:46:52] are doing. Of course. So you have all the money in the world. Probably you can boost everything.</p><p>but </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:46:58] it's still going to take nine months to build a base,</p><p>however much money you have. that's a great mindsets, to, to end our talk with, we can ultimize anything. ethics, aside that we can have our, restrictions there of course. and we should, as an industry, I think, but, we can improve it. </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:47:17] Yes. Also, we always have to think that there is a.</p><p>The economy called classical? No, that was, that was developed. Bye . I don't know how to say in English, but it's a</p><p>that you input a lot of resources in something you are not going to achieve. Same proportion of outputs. So that's a classical. Economical low from the, I think exiting century, I think. And that's completely true. you cannot improve everything to a 100% success rate that's not possible. so you always have to be clear about that.</p><p>Amount of performance, that a company can have, because it's not real to say that you are going to sell at 100% level. So time resources, and also this kind of a staff </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:48:14] sharing us, your experience with, you and, Yeah, good luck with, the promotion and the sales of the second book.</p><p>Of course, we will definitely link to those in the industry show notes, we will link to those books for those that can read Spanish for those that don't, maybe just do a course on Spanish and then. Transitioning through this, this book, that will be a great start. already, you already know all the terms is zero, so there's a lot of English terms.</p><p>I, in the book, I assume. </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:48:41] Yeah. that's all I feel in English. You only have to make the relation in one word for awhile, although yes. In the Spanish. Exactly. But by the main terms are in English. Of course. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:48:49] Thank you so much. </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:48:51] Thank you so much. Should be in a great production </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:48:53] luck to you and, talk to you soon.</p><p>Thanks so much. </p><p>Ricardo Tayar Lopez: [00:48:56] Thank you so much. Bye bye. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:48:58] And this concludes season two episode 40 of this year, or both with Ricardo Tahara from flood one Oh one.

And thanks for listening to another episode of CRO cafe. Today, I speak with a Marta Florentina , which a web analytics manager at the resolution and media. And one of the things we'll be talking about is intelligent tracking protection. My name is Eduardo Yeltsin and welcome to Shira buffet.</p><p>The book does where I show you the behind the scenes of optimization teams and talk with their specialists about data and human driven optimization, and implementing a culture of experimentation and validation. This episode of Ciroc pay is made possible by our partners all in dialogue. And &nbsp;welcome to season two, episode nine.</p><p>So Martha, welcome and great talking to you again. Could you start off by giving us a quick intro to your background and how you started out with optimization </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:00:58] a little bit about myself? I'm in a Polish expert. I'm living in Copenhagen. I've been here for last nine years. beforehand I had been traveling around Europe and spent some time in middle East.</p><p>I'm doing everything from that. That was contained previously in the term digital marketing. I'm trying to get some experience as a student first in severe pain. I don't have this posted for half a year in Poland. I would like to think about myself as an analyst with international experience. So on a daily basis, I'm working as, digital analyst and, data activation, manager, it's, it's Omnicom media group in Copenhagen, a recent hiring here because it's been nine months since I joined, beforehand, I was based in strictly, analytics agency that was based on data.</p><p>from the start. So there to an end, basically all the machine learning and data analytics departments were supporting, conversion rate optimization, PPC, and, SEO departments. So that was a core of the business. While now I'm working mostly with media agencies, and supporting them with data in order to optimize their media buying.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:23] Okay. And, was it the rest of the company do for what kind of services do you provide? </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:02:29] that's everything in terms of media. So we start with our traditional media, of the actually, Book, advert time and radio and TV, but that's only the traditional part that's being scaled down now is obviously, most of the clients would like to advertise in line.</p><p>so there is a department that doing media buying on social media and driving a lot of traffic into the sites. there is also a couple of departments that you, A pool media strategies to pull marketing strategies, meaning that they would do, optimization of, search results as well as, some, paid search ads in order to pull users into the websites.</p><p>There is what's actually twisting is that, conversion rate optimization department does not exist as a department in here, but. Each of the media agency has a conversion rate specialist working and dedicated for that specific department. So for example, what we do in web analytics department is that, we work with, implementation of the KPI strategies and then tracking and a focus on, qualitative, No, obviously quantitative data, in order to provide some optimization insights.</p><p>very recently I teamed up, we've with a qualitative, person said you speak from one of the media agencies and, we work together on aligning our approach. So combining data, with a hypothesis, making a story. Bolus, bullying quite a lot of web analytics into analyzing AB tests. so that's what we are actually planning now.</p><p>And, we've done a couple of features together where, where the clients were super interested in this combined approach, because what we would normally see is that the conversion rate optimization specialists, or rather wandering. softer side of the spectrum. they know it's specifically data driven.</p><p>Some of the decisions might be actually, taken based on gut feeling or just the perception of what actually looks good and should be, and should be done in a certain way, in order to optimize user clicking on specific button and click for rates or a final conversion, if it's commerce, total, it will be a transaction.</p><p>so we try to combine those two approaches, and actually use, Mostly e-commerce data, and visualizing this e-commerce data to be able to find what might be wrong, in an online store. And then, and based on the data that I would prepare, she would then use it, into their hypothesis, building.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:20] Yeah. Those challenges sounds very familiar. </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:05:24] Yeah, you're right. I would say that's the most optimal result is actually tuning up across different departments and, building conversion rates, optimization teams from, from employees that present, to present different approach to the same problem.</p><p>that's what I find more useful. then just, yeah, and just building hypothesis based on gut feeling. yeah, we need to remember that not all users are, are asked basically. we might have completely different perception, especially as digital specialists. Yeah. then, people who've never been on a specific side, they don't know what it's for.</p><p>They are not sure of what is the purpose of it. so yeah, so we need to remember about the user at the very end. That's how we actually teamed up, there. so this, conversion rate optimization specialist, her focus is on the user and obviously mean being, data analyst. My focus is also on the user.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:24] There was a specific reason that you moved to Denmark. Was it the a, is the industry different there? </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:06:30] so before I actually moved to Denmark, I'm here to do the study it's because, what you say, maybe the education system in Poland, that's based on learning things by heart. It's not the best if you really like to understand stuff.</p><p>the practical approach, which of, of education, to education in Denmark was something that caught my attention. so yeah, I packed my suitcase and then the competence on the boards of a plane. And then I arrived in Denmark and, I'm here almost ever since I had couple of periods when I was traveling around Europe and, gaining some experience in here and also in Dubai during this, during, in standard and here, but ultimately it was just the way that people learn stuff in here that, that caught my attention and made me move.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:21] yeah. And I think cultural wise, it's very similar, to the Netherlands. how people, buy online and regarding regulations, I think, you said, before we started recording, he sat there Derek white, some differences still between Denmark and the Netherlands. Right then in terms of Sierra.</p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:07:37] Yeah. what I can say is that every talk during the analytics, and digital analytics Congress last week had some elements in conversion of conversion rate optimization is if a Dutch way would be a focus on the first party data and whatever we can gather on the website. And then try to gain regain control over our own channel or our own platforms in order to make them, get most, optimize towards the users while, as I see to the recent trends in Denmark are rather combining different sources of data in order to.</p><p>provides better usability across the whole journey. There is a big focus on combining offline and online data or, conversions in store. So those offline conversions with online behavior. there is a different approach to what data is actually being used. And as I see it impacts how we do compression rate optimization.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:44] Yeah. You just mentioned you were a speaker there, and you did a session on how to cope with intelligent tracking prevention. and that seems to be quite a hot topic nowadays. It is very important. can you explain for those. that haven't encountered ITP yet, what it is and why it's important.</p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:09:06] that's a wealth of new information. as I like to think about it's all started with, a standard war. So a standard war would be a competition for market dominance or survival between. the two companies that produce a particular type of technology and, that's one thing.</p><p>And another thing is that it's targeted because in my opinion, at least Apple, so drawn into designing and manufacturing devices. That, they slept through this whole phase where, where Amazon or Google or Facebook started to actually capitalize on providing platforms for advertising and using data for that.</p><p>So there's two factors. it shaped how the interest returned with Apple. just, wanting to basically end the dominance of Google and Facebook and Amazon saying, if a year ago is built your whole empires on, advertising cookies and analytics cookies, then we will make sure that one third of the market that's using our browser.</p><p>that you can always capitalize on those people who are using our browsers. So from one point it is standard Warren for, from another point of view, it's just, those four digital giants trying to outmaneuver each others. So that was something that, that shaped. recent, yeah, a recent landscape </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:41] and those giant, those four giants being, Google, Apple, Firefox or slash Mozilla.</p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:10:50] Yeah, that's, that's, it could be sick within the browsers. the whole Bible is about the browsers, but I believe that the motivation towards, limiting, tracking and data sharing opportunities, it extends far beyond his, who's who's has, who has the biggest market share, within browsers?</p><p>Because I'm ultimately, what I think happened is that, Apple was, as I said, so drawn into building devices, that physical devices that they disregarded the importance of data, and now they will come up and, got to know about they, they are getting out maneuvered. so the way that they would like to put us train into, Oh, okay.</p><p>Go on Facebook, capitalizing on them, providing the devices would be just to put an end to where the revenue streams are being driven from, which means from online advertising and use of data. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:47] Yeah. And by the way, looking at the browser market share, I just pulled up some numbers from StatCounter counter.</p><p>And those numbers are very stable. If I look at it, it's those numbers are from September last year until September, this year as basically around 55% Chrome, 26% Safari three, and then actually a Samsung, browsers. so mobile, I would assume it, and 5% Firefox and then for an opposite edge and, around 3%, internet Explorer.</p><p>Does mainly Chrome and Safari as a part of the dominant players here, the Netherlands. </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:12:23] Yeah. And we have over 25% of market share of Safari, which is an Apple browser. So what they've actually done is that they removed one fourth of the markets from, from, being able to be advertised to by Google and Facebook.</p><p>so what, actually Apple has done is that safe. At the beginning, they limited to advertising cookies. and then they removed them completely. So right now, what, when you're not, nobody's being able to target you on a Safari browser. if you are on, let's say, can you go.com or if you, Are reading the news, nobody who's advertising, through Google's channels from Google's platforms is able to target you because your browser does not allow any advertising cookies to be said.</p><p>And me working in a mediation, see that produces some kind of a challenge where, we have a smaller reach, of our campaigns just because those users are denying cookies by default. but obviously there are ways to circumvent that, but on the other hand, being an unlist and getting to know that the first party cookies are also kept within 24 hours, instead of the cookie will expire after 24 hours since the date, it's been said.</p><p>So that would mean if you would come back to my website more than 24 hours, within more than two. 24 hours. I will not be able to recognize that you're the same user. And, I don't really care about the advertising cookies. I can rip out the first party cookies that are screwing up my traffic, because ultimately then, I'm not even able to report on the channel's plate because a single user might have one conversion, but suddenly we'd have two sessions and it will be two users.</p><p>And I'm just kind of person that really likes order in data and really cares about data quality. So this kind of ruins my whole world. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:27] Yeah. I think many Ciro specialists will relate to that statement. We'd like to have order in our data. </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:14:35] In May, 2019, this capping of first party cookies being introduced by Safari.</p><p>And what happened next in September is that, Firefox actually followed through and they, kept all first party cookies by default. So you're not even able to advertise to those people who are using Safari now. There were some temporary solutions people. many specialists actually were recommending to hide solution it's to hide it.</p><p>I think he's from this. Oh, great. And that was, eradicating cookies. the easiest solution was just a piece of the code, that appends your cookies to a local story, but then, at the end of September, what Safari is done, they actually, disabled this function of being able to store anything in the local storage.</p><p>I'm not sure that's what they actually done, but you're not able to store your cookies there because they can be accessed in their bite, the cookie scraping algorithm. Yeah. yeah. we've got a problem. I need to say that. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:34] Yeah. So as a CRO specialist, working for an, a for an agency or on the, if you're on the working on the merchant side, how can you figure out how big this problem is for you?</p><p>How much data you're missing? </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:15:46] I would actually recommend it to couple of analysis. First of all, Apple products are really popular in Denmark. if you're based in another European country, that might be a completely different, but what we see in Denmark, that's, 40 to 60% of, all the browsers are based in Apple devices.</p><p>You can have happy, fair traffic, consistent Chrome, and probably opera and some singer internet Explorer while the other half is Safari. So we'd need to look at this plate of different browsers. You have. And second of all, I would actually look into if the Safari and, and Firefox browsers, what type of buyers, what versions are those?</p><p>Because if your users are, still using the very old versions of Safari at, then your traffic should not be impacted. But, with, version 12.1, this actually has been rolled out and we've seen. From mid may a free quarters of all Safari traffic being actually from the impacted browsers, from the impact is version.</p><p>Yup. what you could do is you could see a trend line of how big of a percentage of your. Of all your sessions are the new sessions. And then if you draw a linear trend line on the percentage of new sessions, what it normally would show for the clients in Denmark that in January, maybe 30 to 40% of all sessions, from the impacted browsers, that was about 30% of new users right now in September, what we say it's about 50%.</p><p>And I'm not really sure that this is because there is more new users being targeted by our campaigns. How would rather say that it's because they come from this impacted versions of this impact with browsers and they're just growing up my data. then what you could also do is, you could look into, the split of the transactions, first of all, you did two segments, one segment of impacted browsers, and then another segment of those browsers that were not impacted.</p><p>And then, go to your eCommerce report, see how this performs for new and existing users. And then we, your two segments supply to be able to actually see, What's the difference in between, new visitors coming from these impacted browsers and not impacted because that's a, that would actually tell you that the, that you can really trust your transactions.</p><p>Dan, there will be just one transaction that occurred. But, your conversion rate would not. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:26] Yeah. And I guess that's also quite dependent on your type of business, right? If you're selling something that most people buy it within 24 hours, then you should be relatively okay. just people take a week or longer.</p><p>if they take it as long as a day, then you have a problem. and then people start, your data starts to be screwed up. </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:18:44] Yeah. if it's just grocery shopping or then. You are able to make a decisions if which cucumber to buy within 24 hours, but any business that's, selling cars or selling apartments or generating leads for the more expensive type of services, I would assume that those.</p><p>the stations take longer to make in buying a cucumber. So those businesses will naturally be more impacted. And once we are on this point that maybe it's time to stop. calling conversion rate optimization. This is, we know the rate is actually based on a session that now we basically cannot trust.</p><p>So maybe we should call it's just conversion optimization. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:31] Yeah. Or that there are a lot of proposed terms I think that are, trying to improve on this service is such a well known term by now. And it's really hard to change, Yeah. a lot of people suggested that we should change the name of the podcast.</p><p>Yeah. But yeah, I also usually try to explain to people that it's not about. It's not about a single KPI that we're going for. And it's more about the mindset of company, of running experiments, validating the changes that you make and looking at the whole customer journey. And I'll just the conversion rate of people buying something online and then ignoring everything else.</p><p>But yeah, there's definitely. There's definitely a branding slash marketing challenge that we have. Isn't it? Yeah. You also spoke about, okay. Now we know what the problem is. now, and somehow to figure out how big the problem is for your own shop, specifically, so what can you do with it?</p><p>I think, during your session, you spoke about, two types of optimizations, right? Optimization, optimizing reach and optimizing performance. so let's talk about optimizing reach first, </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:20:31] right? So what do we come to? and it can be, if everybody coughing to do is that if we don't want to drain our marketing budgets and trying to reach people that we cannot reach anymore, let's just exclude them.</p><p>If we're running any type of a campaigning people or, a DB free 60 at forum. Oh, we should just exclude Safari and Firefox browsers from targeting. I know that it might be painful. And if getting the wider reach, the widest week possible is on top of your marketing strategy, then it might be painful.</p><p>Maybe it's time to rethink. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:10] Yeah. and if all our block browsers full of suits, then you might have a big problem in the near future. All follow them, </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:21:16] not assume that this is actually going to happen until we have another solution in place. obviously what we should be doing for a number of years now, it's starting to be, it's got ring user IDs, bill, because.</p><p>we can, we could not, we will not be able to optimize any business in the future. So to speak, if we are not able to identify our users, if our business, we want to make business online. But if I were a business that does not provide value or which customer would like to pay, being able to register and log in, then we, in the future, won't be able to it'll recognize those users anymore.</p><p>And we won't be able to target them. it means that we need to adapt them, the marketing strategies. And sometimes we need to also adapt the way that we actually are running business. aside of, user IDs, it might be worth looking into building it up. because the SDKs are not based on cookies, they are based on device ID because ultimately, what do you do when you download an app?</p><p>You use your own account on Google or Apple and your own device in order to download this app. And then, the data is actually being tied to your device and you cannot change the device ID as far as I'm concerned. Being able to, for a device ID. So if our users will also bring us some opportunities to target the them based upon those device IDs, obviously that's a big, technical change and sometimes it just doesn't make sense to have an app, but maybe it's time to reconsider.</p><p>and then, start tracking user IDs and device IDs. what do you could also, it would have killed also do if this data is that, there is couple of solutions, technical solutions that are based on stitching device IDs and user IDs. And let's take a scenario that, the same user I, with my login credential to an online store and I'm using, my account on three different devices.</p><p>I usually log in on my desktop. I log in on my phone and I'm locking on my tablet. And then I also might have another phone that we use for work. But sometimes I actually look at the online store on my work phone as well. And that will give us the four, four different devices, but because I'm lumped in with the same account that will give me just one user ID, employing this data in any type of database would then, And give you an opportunity to stitch those four devices to a single user that will give you some insights about my behavior.</p><p>Maybe I'm using the phone in the morning and maybe using desktop in the afternoon, and also based on which device I'm using at what time that will give you some targeting, ideas. Maybe it will be better to, push ads, display banner to me, based on a device ID on my phone, when you'd know that I added stuff to the carpet did not convert.</p><p>And maybe at five o'clock in the afternoon, I'm actually on doing my daily community back to home. So maybe it's a great time to actually they make a purchase. So rethinking our marketing strategies with those device IDs and user IDs. would actually be needed to find a suitable solution for the future.</p><p>Yeah. Obviously, if we are talking about the technical, solutions and not necessarily adapting our whole business, the only viable solution for now, especially if we have multiple domains is, storing cocoa cookies, server side. And I know that there are many concerns, about if it's a GDPR compliant, but I would assume that as long as we don't have a lawsuit against a company, who's actually storing cookies server side, then we would not know if this is actually a legitimate interest of the company to preserve the cookies.</p><p>Or if it's actually, impacting, the rights of the, of the day just have, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:32] okay. And, but the F for, the sending of those cross domain tracking orders, user ID RDS, it does require clients to either log login or DCF need to have some continuous flow of data. </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:25:46] Val does have always been a fan of actually just hitting single Google analytics property that would aggregate all the traffic.</p><p>Yeah, I know that's maybe a fresh hole is a bit too low. If you're running an online business across many, for example, European countries that is the fresh hold and the headquarter might be too low to actually be able to, send the data to one place. But it's ultimately what it does is that it says the same cookie ID because it's two based on cookies, but it says the same cookie ID.</p><p>Across different domains and across different devices. So that's a, that was always my preferred way. now if we consider, Google's environment and the way that they've handled, merging app and web data, this is actually being done with the new type of properties it's been live since August in beta.</p><p>And over there, you can actually, Target's your Firebase project to send data to this property, as well as from Google check managers, send your data, your website data at the same property and the stitching. I need to emphasize that it's still embedded in beader, but this teaching that's being done in there is being done basically on device IDs and user IDs.</p><p>there is another solution provided by Tealium. in audience stream, you're able, to determine what is the user identifier, and then being able to teach different sessions, containing different cookies together based on this, identifier and. That's called profiles teaching within all the industry.</p><p>And this solution has been in place for quite some time. Obviously they are also able to gather information from the app. So if you're sending device ID, that can also form on one of the institutions </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:27:40] and do we know how well that works? Are there any downsides or any drawbacks of that? </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:27:44] again, any drawback I can actually see because, the Google's solution is to, in pizza, they advise, the users, especially in the end users companies to actually start.</p><p>people being on this feature and, they've really been working on developing the Firebase tracking for quite some time now. So that's been on a timeline, but I would say that if it's still in beta, it's not red yet. I assume that they need to gain some, critical mass of users, before.</p><p>There are algorithms that are actually stationed out, are able to certify that this is a percent foolproof, while BD Tillium solution it's been in place for a couple of years now. And, I've actually set it up once seen it's working. It's pretty awesome. ultimately they also pretty agnostic.</p><p>Civic could point also your Google analytics data. I'll put there and collect data through Firebase, into audience stream &nbsp;stream and work on the same principle. so it depends on the marketing landscape because on the marketing stack as well, because it depends what preferred vendor, if God, so you might be a patchwork of different systems.</p><p>and then you'd like a vendor that's doing this teaching to be as agnostic as possible while if you're a hundred percent, Google stock is best to just stay within Google. Start. Start stitching, your device IDs and user ID is now and then leverage it later. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:21] Yeah. Yeah. And I guess most of us are stuck in the Google stack because that's what most of us are using.</p><p>And most of the clients at least are using. yeah. So that's about optimizing reach and then the second part optimizing performance. </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:29:36] So given that we have 24 hours to make people convert. let's find out what prevents them from conferring of it's eliminate that friction as fast as possible.</p><p>And, yeah, later on let's hope for the best maybe, People usually like conversion rate optimization. They also always focused on success. We need to talk to myself, our conversion rate. We need to, decrease the bounce rate, increase the engagement, but at the very end, maybe it's very small, annoying detail.</p><p>That's preventing users from actually converting. back on, measure camp in may, in Rome, one of, one of the conversion rates slash web analytics specialists, from Finland was present. his name is Mikko and he actually outlined this couple of metrics that you can use. To measure how annoyed or irritated your users are.</p><p>So for example, he suggested measuring, number of clicks per page view and. I know it's from my own experience, when I'm super annoyed, I would just try to make the website response and I would click around many times repeatedly and be super angry. And I'm then using this metric together with the, that the page views, the page reports in Google analytics, but can actually see.</p><p>That may be some page is simply not responsive, or maybe the user just cannot click on proceed to checkout because there are features like responsive. There is no link on there. It might be a very simple thing that's super long, and it might have a tremendous effect on just fixing this pinpointing those really annoying thing.</p><p>And then fixing this specific thing. I remember I downloaded an app when I was visiting my parents in Warsaw. We were supposed to go on, on the trip on the bikes and city bikes. but the way that, the app was scaled did not fit my. A crappy Chinese phone. So I was not able to actually fill out my details and we spent around two hours then wait, then waiting for me, like my whole family on bikes that can we go now?</p><p>And me not being able to actually, I wanted to be able to shake the city bike up. so just measuring this number of frustrated, annoyed clicks. on a screen view or a page view, could give us a lot of insights. then what Mika also suggested is that, we can also track the confusion of our users.</p><p>just dividing the amount of, page views by unique page views would give us the confusion rate. It will show us if our users are. within a single session going back and forth again, or maybe a specific page does not provide them with the information that they need, or, they just simply are not able to find a specific information they want.</p><p>a good example for a commercial client would be, That's crawling through a page where you're supposed to fill out something, actually it's close your, what do you call it? Crawl is close your form as well. So that you just cannot catch it because it just moving around, just crawl, so to speak.</p><p>And it's also super cool, annoying. And then this user would be able to find a form to fill out, for example, the address, and we'll be walking back and forth within the checkout funnel and not being able to provide a dress. Yeah, that's obviously a very, and large case of what can be wrong, but, if, a thing like that exist that will have tremendous effects on the conversion rate with the variant.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:33:15] I think those are great tips, And I know some of the analytics tools, Yeah, they also, try to, to measure, noise and confusion. I think those are particularly, fun, fun, useful things to be tracking and, the way you set them up. I think those are very useful and easy to eat, easy to set up.</p><p>And, very useful to, to detect pages, or user that are, getting frustrated easily. </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:33:37] There is also another thing because, sometimes we know that there's something wrong with our checkout, but maybe if we work on the client side, you're not able to get resources. We would be normally called off saying, the sales are flowing in, so you ain't fixing something that's not broken.</p><p>Or maybe we're not going to give you our precious developer's time to figure out what is broken. So what I would normally suggest is to, track what we call a missed revenue. So normally with the e-commerce tracking, we have our revenue, but maybe if we also, track the full price of products in checkout across the whole checkout flow, and then substructure that.</p><p>From the total revenue or the other way around. And we would know how much revenue we actually missed. And on the next meeting where we had to fight for resources with another department, and we are a conversion rate optimization specialist, we can just present this one number per month or per week saying that we are losing.</p><p>Thousands of euros, just because you're not willing to give us assistance of developers to find out what's wrong. So we could actually use this list revenue metric as a form of, internal buy in. And I like this idea very much. I think it's tremendous because it actually would show everyone that hour conception preconception of knowing that something is wrong.</p><p>Can actually be quantified in a way that speaks out to top management very well, because we are just talking about money desk and another are going to be able to </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:35:24] exactly another thing. That's a great thing that we can do in general with conversion optimization rights. if we were an experiments and we see the difference that it makes, but then it's maybe not implemented, we can just present to the board or whoever's in charge.</p><p>Say, okay. We losing this amount of money every month because you cannot implement it or you won't implement it. It's up to you. That's fine. It's fine. It's your choice, but, </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:35:49] yeah. Yeah. As you said for missing implementation, yep. I know that sometimes, development projects, they got store like it's taught along the way and takes for ages to actually have something implemented or new websites rolled out and, tracking of missed revenue also provides the sense of urgency setting that we have to fix it as fast as possible because that's a big drain on our budget.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:36:18] Yeah. </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:36:20] Especially if you're buying a lot of traffic, that's not being able to go through. so if you're combining this region performance, strategies together, And, you buy buying crazy amounts of traffic. It's super expensive. You send them for this checkout funnel, but they are talking, along the way, then just being able to recalculate that, to a missed revenue would be, a pretty, a pretty big things.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:36:46] so would it be like a standard dashboard that you usually set up to show miss </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:36:50] revenue or. Yeah, what I would normally do start, I'm a big fan of dashboards, especially if we want to achieve something. and, what I would normally do is out fire a goal per a checkout step or her, her e-commerce action in separate Google analytics view.</p><p>Jen, I would send this data from this specific, Events tracking slash goal slash e-commerce tracking view in state of studio. And I would recalculate, then swap of rates in between, different steps. Oh, the checkout funnel or just the whole e-commerce flow. And doing cuts in data studio and based on the goal.</p><p>So I was for, segmenting that data with more dimensions and we can obviously send our, missed revenue on with each of the steps. and that's, I find it's, it sends a pretty powerful message because then we'll be able to allocate on which step are we actually losing the most of revenue and, Kind of pinpoint, maybe there is a specific device that's responsible for that, or, maybe they're a specific channel, responsible for that.</p><p>And then we can use all of our custom diamond insurance as well. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:38:06] and, but for those, those dashboards, for missed revenue, usually you need to do some assumptions for that, right? like external factors staying the same. and when you implemented it might not actually bring the revenue that you, that you predicted.</p><p>so how do you handle that internally? and yeah, managing expectations on that front. </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:38:23] and then that's the problem, because then we need to start hypothesizing because we might know that something is wrong, but we might not be sure what exactly is wrong. And that's where, more humane people would actually step in like my conversion rate optimization colleague.</p><p>and we would look into data together and then we would also debug the checkout flow probably, or the whole e-commerce setup, on the side. and what's the most interesting is, you could also support this data in a way that. You sit with someone who never been on a page, and then you just ask Jim to make a purchase of a product, and then you are set up a screen recording on that and, When you're sitting next to the person, you might actually experience what it's like to do it for the first time.</p><p>Because if you would just set up screen recording, eh, with Hotjar, then you don't know if these people are first time there, did they maybe browse from different device? Are they acquainted to the brands were not so doing this, peer to peer reviews, it's actually very valuable and that can support your analysis along the way.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:39:37] I think that's a great note to, to end our recording. thanks so much. Marta, I think that's a lot of, yeah, food for thought for us. So to think about an a in this hero industry, and maybe, maybe in a couple of, mal maybe months, but probably years, we can figure out a better way to, to call our industry besides us Euro.</p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:39:58] So be interesting. Very welcome. And thank you. Thank you for the invitation as well. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:40:02] Welcome and talk to you soon. </p><p>Marta Florentyna Saratowicz: [00:40:05] Thanks. Bye.

So this should feel familiar. And, author of books to persuasion slides Brainfluence and, lays the one, friction, the untapped for that can be your most powerful advantages</p><p>Guido: [00:01:15] Very good. And, so I assume you brought your, friction goggles, right? </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:01:19] Yes. I didn't bring the physical ones with me, but I do actually have a demo pair that sometimes I carry around, but all my friction goggles are always present in my mind. </p><p>Guido: [00:01:28] It's good. so I would definitely read the book then you'll know about the goggles </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:01:32] and that long string subtitle took weeks of negotiation between me and McGraw Hill to arrive at.</p><p>And finally it was like, whatever, this is good </p><p>Guido: [00:01:42] enough. It was an AB test. What the title? </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:01:44] no, they aren't into a testing. </p><p>Guido: [00:01:48] So I saw some, improvements to be made with, </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:01:50] although I did do some actual testing on the cover and the cover design, using eye-tracking some other tools. So there was a testing component involved.</p><p>Guido: [00:02:00] Nice. </p><p>Audience: [00:02:01] And, </p><p>Guido: [00:02:01] we have, Bart squirts, chief psychology officer at online dialog. Keynote speaker at every CRO conference around the world, and an active consumer psychologist. And I'm also active as a nip. what's your executor, the name of the committee again, </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:02:19] it's the sections for economic and consumer psychologists.</p><p>What do you guys do there? And I'm chairing the board. It was just easy. Cause I found that the section, it was very easy to become. </p><p>Guido: [00:02:30] That helps that's the trick. </p><p>Audience: [00:02:33] first, so </p><p>Guido: [00:02:34] we're talking about psychology and friction. I think that's a, an easy win. So Roger, so the friction is always bad. Let's start with that one.</p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:02:46] Actually, friction isn't always bad. It is bad most of the time. And generally it slows down progress. In most fields. It makes customer experience worse. It makes employee experience worse, which reduces employee engagement, which there's a huge crisis in today. At least in the United States with employees not being actively engaged with our company.</p><p>It determines a which region succeed and fail and this sort of, but it can be used in a positive way to steer behavior. if you have two paths, adding friction to an undesirable path, assuming it's in the interest of the consumer or the employee can be a good thing. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:03:23] And the Barts I hurt you. </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:03:25] I do not agree.</p><p>That's </p><p>Guido: [00:03:28] why I didn't prepare any questions because </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:03:31] I think it's a, it totally depends on whether a consumer is better off or it's more persuaded with our, without friction. We have a lot of examples where adding friction actually, helps sales, and desire popups in front of your screen, which has to click away, which actually increases conversion rates are.</p><p>yeah, it totally depends. And I think that's the nightmare of psychology. That it's human behavior. It's very complex. It's dependent on internal brain processes on external situational factors. And in that complexity, we are very not good in predicting what's going to work or not. And that also applies for friction in an analyst.</p><p>We have a seeing &nbsp;and I think that like an offer of the cases without the </p><p>Guido: [00:04:18] friction, there's no shine. </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:04:19] There's no shine without friction. And so it can be a very good thing. For the consumer, right? Elsa. friction for me is also making products comparable. So people are more following their intuition.</p><p>When they choose and it's a less rational tourist, but at least they, So if you're presenting, for example, hotels, I think it's adding friction that you emphasize different aspects of the different hotels. So one hotel will have a very good restaurant. The other one will have a perfect view. And the last one is very easy to reach.</p><p>Whereas all three of them have a good restaurant are easy to reach in there. I have a perfect view, but by. Emphasizing these aspects, people are more easily choosing spend less of their time of their lives, considering which hotel. And actually they're more happy with our chores afterwards. So is it a bad thing?</p><p>I don't think it's a, it totally depends. </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:05:10] No, it does depend. And I think, for example, the popup example is great. I hate to say it, but on my websites I have a popup to subscribe and it does convert. but at the same time, if you're looking for longterm, longterm customer relationship, you will never go to Amazon and see a popup.</p><p>they're very focused on a very smooth customer experience. So it just depends on your objective. </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:05:34] Yeah, it </p><p>Guido: [00:05:34] does. It's also a longterm versus short term thing. Like the popup works right now. I would be the longterm. </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:05:41] I think, a consumer decision with friction will. On average leads to more loyalty than very easy choice, right?</p><p>if you're at tonight, persuading each other, it's better to play hard to get then to be very easy to get, right. In terms of loyalty in the long run, animate says strange metaphor, but I think if consumers are more interacting with your platform, Because she didn't make it too easy. It might turn out that they see themselves as interacted with the platform on a longer term.</p><p>So strategically it might lead to longterm or loyalty. If you make it a slightly more difficult. </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:06:23] Okay. That'd be a great test. Yeah. It's and I would predict, but in different circumstances that you might get different results. Sure. The, in fact, some brands are famous for adding friction to their process, try and buy a Lamborghini.</p><p>For example, you're not going to. Unnecessarily necessarily just pop down your dealer and drive away in one. You may have to preorder it. You may have to go to some distant place to pick it up and so on. And that's true, </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:06:48] but you'd send a Tarion easy daily products. You shouldn't add friction. </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:06:52] Right?</p><p>Lamborghini was real easy to buy back every one after that's been difficult. </p><p>Guido: [00:06:57] Yeah. It's so annoying. do we already have questions about how to play hard to get or friction or psychology? Who wants to go first? It's the best one. We all remember that first question. </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:07:10] Hi, my </p><p>Audience: [00:07:11] name is Corrine. cultural differences.</p><p>that's U S Europe. Let's put it that way. Is there in psychology, grading friction, thus cultural differences. Make a different, </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:07:24] yes, I think, I didn't get into that a lot, but I think different cultures do certainly have different expectations of how easy a transaction might be, in China, in the.</p><p>In my stores, which are not the same. I found on this trip as the Dutch eMAR stores, the Chinese in my stores, everything takes place via their mobile app. You check out with your face, you pay with your face and it's a totally different experience. And we would find that very strange and difficult, but they find it very easy.</p><p>it's almost frictionless for them. </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:07:59] Yeah. But I do like to emphasize the fact that, Homosapiens is in essence, very similar. Every one of us is a human and our brains don't work very different, no matter what culture you're from or what skin color you have. So the baseline is where similar, and then there are slight differences, which I'm </p><p>Guido: [00:08:19] citrus similar and nurtures different.</p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:08:22] yeah. Not sure about the nature by the nature different cause like the biggest difference between the individualistic. Countries. And we're not that different from the state, even here in Europe and the more, like the Asian, how do you call that? The groups group sense, community oriented that's that is a big cultural difference.</p><p>And what I tend to do nowadays, thanks to the Sierra world is if people ask questions like this, I look at the bigger data driven platforms like Facebook or Amazon and see whether they are presenting different. Interfaces to different countries. And they hardly ever do the differences are too small to start segmenting for those groups.</p><p>But China is exactly the one exception, right? So booking.com Facebook, they look different. So they're testing found out. that they need different UIs over there. But on the other hand, there are no differences between booking.com in the U S or here in Europe. and segment testing as a segment, again, has a difficult effect for your testing, right?</p><p>Reduces power makes testing more complex. So weird. Tend to prevent that. That's why we're in the CRO business. We're not a big fan of personalization. I know you all want to learn about personalization, but you should test where the personalization works in a very proper high powered AB test because we haven't seen a lot of powerful personalization solutions yet.</p><p>so then when it comes to individual or cultural differences, be very careful because the differences are small, right? The big goal, the big thing is we're all very similar. </p><p>Audience: [00:10:01] Yeah. </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:10:02] So I would say, I would ever say the other thing you should test first are more situational factors where people are, they can decide for one product or another very differently.</p><p>If they're in a different situation, that's going to be like a counter effective effect, not a slightly more or less. It's 180 degrees different. So I would more look into those differences. </p><p>Guido: [00:10:26] Next question. </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:10:30] His name is . Yes. </p><p>Audience 3: [00:10:31] And where do your work? </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:10:33] I work </p><p>Audience 3: [00:10:33] for online dialogue, CRO manager. the topic of this talk was consumer psychology in CRO.</p><p>I was actually just talking to Roger that we asked converse specialist or anyone working this market knows so much more. We get so much more data and we can do learn so much more Fs, psychology, dentists, academics, and. No, that's just </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:10:52] the economics part. </p><p>Audience 3: [00:10:54] Bart's you were at a bunch of lawyers, I think two months ago.</p><p>And you told them about our data, which you have, </p><p>Audience 2: [00:11:00] so </p><p>Audience 3: [00:11:00] consumer psychology in CRO, </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:11:02] what, </p><p>Audience 3: [00:11:02] but the people working at it, </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:11:04] what position should we </p><p>Audience 3: [00:11:04] take? How should we help these people ethical wise, however, </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:11:09] should we grow, </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:11:09] help the academics? You mean? Yeah, I think that's a very valid point because when you read some of these studies, they get.</p><p>Tremendous traction. And we read the details and it was 50 undergraduate students at a particular university, which it's great, but it may not really represent anything beyond, that this is why there's been a replication crisis and some, actually well-known. Authors and psychologists have been somewhat disgraced and have left their universities because, the data that they were using was weak.</p><p>They were using some techniques to find stuff, find significance where there really wasn't and. Ah, as a result, nobody else could replicate the data where I think that, the data that many CRO agencies collect, if it's done in a very large sample that is reproducible, now, things can change over time or they could change in a different situation, but by and large, you can't really assail the, quality of that data.</p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:12:11] What was the question? Is that the question, like how should psychologists within companies take their role or more of the CRO specialist? Yeah. </p><p>Audience 3: [00:12:19] I actually had the people working a CRO, ethical ice, Cedar position within other lines of work. How should we help the lawyers? How should it should be help academics?</p><p>Should we, </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:12:27] yeah, so I think it's a data over psychology and it's exactly what, Russia is emphasizing. The, the whole behavioral science world is based on low powered samples of, usually Western females in the age, in between 18 and 22. And the external validity is very low. And the replication crisis is also because they have a false discovery rates.</p><p>That's not different from ours. And we nowadays know that at least 50% of our winning tests are false winners, which is also always the bad news. If we enter a new company that was working with an immature of agency, but. if I look at the current scientific that the big scientific institutions, and we go to code conference in Boston, MIT, half of the talks are by Oxford and Hartford.</p><p>Half of the talks are by Facebook and Amazon. And because they have that data and it's so in your role as CRO expert, You, your fight is against all your opinions and all the knowledge exists in the company, which is bullshit knowledge and psychologists don't have an answer. They only say it's very complex.</p><p>You don't know you should test that, but that's exactly the role you have. So the cultural shifts is a very big thing. And I think CRO experts are the wants to take up that role, but then we need different skillset, right? We have to be cultural change managers instead of very nerdy data driven, we think is very sexy experimentation and data driven this, but it's not very much.</p><p>Yeah. So we need to develop those persuasive skills, not only on the interface of our website, but especially within the company be more persuasive and, you learn how influenceable people are. So let's save a place for a year and Mark, </p><p>Guido: [00:14:19] before you go to Richard. And so for those that didn't study psychology, why are all almost all psychology studies, have participants that are 18 to 24 year old and are female.</p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:14:29] Oh, because we need a respondent. So is that what you call it? Participants in the study. So it just, yeah, so we just force psychology students to participate. You're not graduating without participating in at least 40 experiments. So there've been tested over and over again, but, and that's where the whole Bavel science is built upon.</p><p>Yeah. So we also subjects that are probably aware of the fact that they're being tested, which makes the external validity completely nonsense. </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:14:59] Jeez students too. So they're not necessarily unaware of the type of tests they might be undergoing. </p><p>Guido: [00:15:04] I very vividly remember, doing a one study at the university.</p><p>It's a very similar study and Indeed's, 80%, as women, that's a, it's a psychology study. </p><p>Audience 2: [00:15:14] The study </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:15:14] was one of the reasons to study it for me. It was, yeah. </p><p>I studied physics before that wasn't. That was, it was different. </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:15:23] We didn't have that preponderance of women at my university, but I would say that just to echo what Bart was saying about real world experimentation platforms like Uber now are also publishing studies, not necessarily in CRO, but I just.</p><p>Heard an interesting study about tipping, where they can conduct these massive at-scale studies effects of tipping, where they've got really great statistics where, 10 years ago, an academic environment, it would be, some tiny sample and the other area. That's also afflicted by small sample sizes.</p><p>I've been writing about neuro marketing for years, and I'd probably some of you are familiar with that. Some of those studies, especially those using FMRI, which is a very. A powerful but expensive way to measure what brain activity while people are consuming content or viewing things. there, the sample size might be as low as 10 or 15 or 20 subjects.</p><p>And that's, it's interesting, but it's not really all that convincing. </p><p>Guido: [00:16:16] Yeah. And like I said, there can be big buyers in there. And, the study I remember is that we did a study on, you had to rate the taste of a piece of chocolate, and the, just to give you a piece of chocolates and you had to rate them on a scale of one to 10 or something.</p><p>and they, they gave you piece of paper with the chocolate and the brand name was written on it. So this is a piece of fact data. This is a piece of Milka, but I, so I got this piece of . And on the chocolate, that sad Milka so you're pretty sh you pretty sure you're in an experiment then. I didn't really </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:16:49] all those experiences.</p><p>Everyone's always looking what's the trick, right? If someone is dropping his pen, Oh, I probably am supposed to pick it up. </p><p>Audience 2: [00:16:55] So </p><p>Guido: [00:16:56] that's how a lot of those studies go into, any audience </p><p>Audience 2: [00:17:00] questions, </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:17:00] maybe this is also a nice extra answer for Houben. You have the power to publish in scientific papers.</p><p>How convincing is that in your company? That what you're doing is very valid, right? even science is asking for it for that information. Then your board members should listen as well. Yup. </p><p>Guido: [00:17:21] Anyone who wants to walk up</p><p>given wants to go again? </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:17:28] I have a question for the audience. You're running way more experiments than any bagel scientific professor will ever do in his life. You've tested with more participants, then he will even encounter in his life. do you have, do you try to learn from these experiments are framed other way around, like who does not try to learn from his experiments?</p><p>Because I don't.</p><p>cause I don't think we're learning anything. Because I see a lot of learnings. </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:18:01] So it was a murder </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:18:04] one too. Are you </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:18:06] saying that we aren't trying to draw more generalized knowledge from the results of the experiment. In other words, we find a result. Okay. this has this particular effect. So we'll go with option B instead of option a, but we're not drawing any longer term knowledge from it.</p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:18:23] Yes, I do. I see reports of AB tests where there's a learning included. And I think that the learning never holds and that's something we learned in behavioral science that when you have a hypothesis, An experiment. We'll never prove the hypothesis. If you read a scientific article, there's never one experiment.</p><p>There always a hell of a lot of experiments, because there are alternative explanations possible for the effect that you found, which might not be your hypothesis. So in science, you have to counter all the. Other possible explanations. And I see no one doing that. And as long as she don't do that, you're not learning.</p><p>And then who cares? Your boss doesn't care. He just wants you to grow the company. So stop learning, stop growing the com start growing the company. Right? Learning. Sorry. Fake our bullshit. it's not true if you want it to be true, which I would love to, because I love the fact that we were finally able to learn from human behavior, but it involves at least 10 experiments for one hypothesis, because you have to prove all the, I can go, come up with a lot of, yeah, give me a.</p><p>And they'd be winning AB tests. And I'll tell you a lot of explanations, why that might've happened and you'll have to find out which one is the true one. Knowing that 50%, at least of your winners will be a false positive. it's difficult to learn from human behavior. It's very hard to prove a hypothesis.</p><p>So either just stopped doing it, which I think is a very healthy thing to do or do it properly. But that involves. A lot of effort. And that's why we also have a reputation crisis in psychology because we also didn't have the fence to do it properly powered properly. </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:20:05] I think you're fighting human nature there.</p><p>Bart, because people want an explanation. If one thing worked better than another thing, we immediately want to explain why for </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:20:15] meaning it's messaging our brain. You always want to know why. By the age of six, she asked the why question 300 times a day, stop doing that because we just don't know it's a nightmare.</p><p>Test me as a dead. Cause I always get the answer. I don't know. I didn't test it.</p><p>Guido: [00:20:35] I'll give that a try. Yeah. Any audience questions </p><p>Audience 2: [00:20:42] I'm Bulger from Alabama or whatever, but it feels like I'm in a crisis now because if all kinds of consumer psychology, which is based on four studies, and we think we have learning from SIRA, which is from false tests. Can we be better than not stop and start drinking?</p><p>Guido: [00:21:05] I think 15 minutes. </p><p>Audience 2: [00:21:06] Yes. </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:21:07] 15 minutes thing that the positive side of you're asking for. Is there anything positive in a, in applying psychology within CRO is in the ideation phase because if you're not. Into psychology. Then you will test too much rational IDs, I'd say it's it's especially, I love Roger Dooley's blog just to get ideas.</p><p>And that's also why I'm not against neuro marketing. I know the studies are bullshit, but it just gives you another twist in your ideation phase. And the problem with Aramark is also the statistics behind the data analysis. There's a huge bias in there as well. Anyhow, so you have different ideas, right?</p><p>And. The smallest change is going to have the biggest effects. We all see that on a daily basis, we're unable to predict the outcomes, but the better IDs are always based from the psychology background. We did a meta analysis within KPN, which is one of our bigger clients. So there were hundreds of experiments and we tracked the source of the hypothesis.</p><p>So we had three, three types of sources. There was the, like the opinions from the company, right? One third of their IDs is just people that saw something happening at Vodafone Zika, for example, or just tested that, that is, that has a winner chance ratio. That's a lower than a random. So we have a threshold and we find less winners than you'd expect randomly.</p><p>So that's very bad IDs, right? So that's why we tag them because we want our false discovery rate to be as low as possible. And we know that these IDs are bringing the fastest, so we, that's why we track them. So that's not the way to go. That's what a lot of companies do. Then we have the data driven.</p><p>CRO team, but not behavioral expert tests. Good thing is when a ratio is above the random threshold that you would expect. So they're actually bringing value and. And I think they're false discovery rate is somewhere around 70%. So one third of the test is it's a true winner. So there that's, it's bringing value, but then we have the central effects, steam where I'd be able scientists from our company are involved and they have four times higher real winner.</p><p>So we're at the data driven team has an average value per test of 30,000 euros. Our team has over a hundred thousand euros, average weight. Sorry. Is there value in psychology in CRO? </p><p>Audience 2: [00:23:46] He says there is, </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:23:47] but what is it? It's not. it's the ideation phase. They have different ideas that the other people will think of are they would discuss the ID.</p><p>And then with our rational conscious brain, we will counter the ID. That's bad. </p><p>Guido: [00:24:01] The bar does it mean that you guys are also testing as zero teams with, and without psychologists and put them against each other? </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:24:09] They were scaling up and having multiple teams and that the other teams didn't involve psychologist.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:24:13] yeah. And I think wrong to conclude from the replication issues that all psychology is bullshit. And in fact, there are many principles out there that have been proven many times both in lab experiments in universities, but also in commercial tests, I look at Cialdini's principles. For example, those are commonly used in.</p><p>Tests of all kinds and various other things you just have to be. I think the ones that studies have to be more careful of are the one off studies where a professor found some really startling thing. And of course that's what gets the press says. If it's a strange finding, like if you're on the second floor of the mall, you were more generous in your donations than you're on the first floor.</p><p>that's, it's really fascinating and certainly gets press coverage. But, you really want to be sure that's been replicated by other researchers and other locations. And a lot of that it's called embodied cognition. A lot of that now is looking very shaky. And but the basic principles are certainly valid.</p><p>Some, there are certain experiments things like, the ultimatum game, the, but you are free thing that had been tested in dozens of labs around the world. And I have pretty good basis for them. </p><p>It </p><p>Guido: [00:25:19] could also be an SRM. On the second floor, right? Simple rice ratio. Ms. Mismatch there. </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:25:25] Oh yeah, exactly.</p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:25:27] Like a simple science are too low to be able to measure simple ratio mismatch. </p><p>Audience: [00:25:31] Yeah. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:25:32] That's another issue. Yeah. </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:25:34] I definitely, you have to look at why were those people on the second floor, maybe the people on the first floor were in a hurry to get to the second floor and they weren't going to stop.</p><p>And don't, who knows, there are many other alternate explanations for that, which is why as Bart says, you really need to test alternatives and make sure he got robust data. </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:25:50] Yeah. there's a lot of courses out there that you can at least have an introduction into psychology, which I think is already very good.</p><p>But it's also very good to hire a trained psychologist who studied behavior human behavior for four years full time. You're never going to catch up with someone who was so studied. So intensely </p><p>Guido: [00:26:11] you, your psychology study. It was full time. </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:26:15] I studied some psychology nine years, even </p><p>Guido: [00:26:20] twice as good. </p><p>Audience 2: [00:26:21] At least </p><p>Audience: [00:26:23] we have time for </p><p>Guido: [00:26:24] one final audience question.</p><p>So this is your chance who wants to go? Yes. </p><p>Audience: [00:26:31] Yeah. My name is Josh from &nbsp;and I would like to know what is, in your opinion, the most underrated psychological principle in CRO.</p><p>Guido: [00:26:44] The most underrated, psychological principle in Sera or the most effective then, or that's not being used</p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:26:53] yeah, but could be very, I would say the most overrated one is social proof. That's so counter effective very often. Social proof, always test social programming. It has an impact, It's very impactful, but. The direction is very questionable. we did, let's see if she's applying social proof when you're trying to sell loans.</p><p>I they've always been counter effective. We don't want to be reminded of others when we're doing something that those others dislike. So it has a huge impact, but in the wrong direction, So I think that's </p><p>Guido: [00:27:27] that's absolutely. I was give the other example that they found watching a boring video.</p><p>I don't want to know how, which of my friends</p><p>same time. Yes. </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:27:40] Okay. I'll </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:27:41] test that. That would be </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:27:44] out. That is probably less utilized simply because it's the less known of Cialdini's principles. Moses his six have been out for 35 years or something. Now, just a couple of years ago in his book, Pre-Suasion produced a unity, that is like a very powerful form of liking it's shared identity, familial identity, and it's all it goes beyond simply having something in common with somebody else.</p><p>It's like being part of the same tribe, to really put it in a very simple way. And, when you can do that, you can be more persuasive, although sometimes the opportunities to show that you're a part of the same tribe as somebody else are pretty limited in a large business setting one business that I think because tried to leverage that is Tito's vodka from Austin, Texas.</p><p>They're now a well known national brand in the U S I don't know how well known they are over here, but. Oh, not too long ago. They adopted a slogan vodka for dog people, which is a very unusual thing. Obviously dogs in vodka have nothing to do with each other. but they did a couple of things. First of all, he tapped into a very large group of people who were.</p><p>Favorable to pets and dogs. Secondly, they didn't say for dog owners or dog lovers, I said dog people. So they're trying to bring in this identity that we share this identity and then actually a very golfing, they did nothing to do with principles, but they also created a hashtag, a vodka for dog people.</p><p>So the people who would not normally share a picture of their vodka bottle on their Instagram feed, I would, in fact, show their pet, wearing a sweater with the vodka, with a Tito's logo on it. they would have a Tito's dog food bowl or water bowl, or in some cases they would even pose their pet with a bottle of Tito's vodka and use that hashtag.</p><p>So not only did they create this, liking or maybe even unity effect with the slogan, they turned into a, something that could be shared on social media. </p><p>Guido: [00:29:44] Thank you. Roger. </p><p>Audience 2: [00:29:45] Can I also </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:29:46] give a one tip? I think a very underrated persuasion tactic is variable rewards. Our brain is looking forward to rewards, right?</p><p>It's not the reward in moment itself. It's the anticipation of a reward that is driving a lot of our motivation. And if you want it to be very persuasive in the longterm, you have two variations, the, both the intensity of the reward and the timing of the reward. And I see no one experimenting with very well rewarding your returning customers to, in order to create loyalty.</p><p>Guido: [00:30:24] So I'd say I heard you guys tonight. When you order a drink, you'll either get a shot of water. You get a beer, you get a wine, </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:30:32] but it's going to be buried. Yeah. Also, since you're going to feed it to your dog, I just heard. </p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:30:39] Yeah, I actually did see a one, like a Starbucks rewards tend to be very predictable.</p><p>You accumulate points. When you have enough points, then you get a free thing. but a competitor Panera. I was actually doing that random thing for a while where, there may have been some kind of algorithm driving it. But as a consumer, you weren't really aware of suddenly you saw an email or something on your app, pop up, Hey, you get a free cup of coffee or you get a free pastry.</p><p>So I assumed that's what they were doing. Although whether they were doing it consciously or not at </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:31:08] all, no. Yeah. And reward is not only financial, right? It's especially, it's not financial. It's just telling people, Hey, you're doing a good job. You're almost there. All these green check marks that we play with small sentences.</p><p>Those are always, those are also rewards for people that they're doing the right thing. So if you're going to vary eight more with it, it's going to be more sticky and more create loyalty creating. And so I think that's. Like a very basic principle from psychology. If even if you're teaching your kids new behavior, you're going to reward them.</p><p>Do it very rule dude, unexpected. They cannot, you shouldn't. They should not be able to predict whether they're going to get a reward and how high the reward will be. But, and usually a reward is just a compliment from you and it's a big compliment, small compliment. So it's a very basic principle in psychology, which I think is very underrated in Sierra.</p><p>Roger Dooley: [00:31:56] Yeah, a great reference is hooked by NIR Eyal who shows how these companies that have us all addicted to our devices, use of variable rewards. It's a good effect. If people, if every time you posted it on Instagram, the same 20 likes it, wouldn't be interesting, but the fact that you get five one time and 200, the next time, that makes it exciting to you.</p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:32:18] Near who also spoke at Culverson hotel. </p><p>Guido: [00:32:21] Yeah.</p><p>thank you for all the questions. it, wasn't a final session and thanks for to a fortune hotel organization to have us here this year. Make sure to subscribe, see road cafes. I should subscribe then a </p><p>Bart Schutz: [00:32:42] reward </p><p>Guido: [00:32:42] with variable rewards. Yes, bye bye.</p><p>‍</p>",true,

And welcome to a CRO.CAFE session here at Digital Elite Day. I'm joined by Abi and Craig, thank you so much for joining me. And the topic we're talking about is self-development for CRO's, and how to become a better CRO Professional. And hopefully we assume you want to be better at what you do anyway, because that's a trait of CRO: we want to make things better.</p><p>So why not? Why stop at the website or customer journeys. And let's continue with this and try to improve ourselves as well. We have over 100 people joining the session. welcome everyone. if you have any questions, you can use the chat here in zoom to ask them and I'll see if I can, put them in front of Craig or Abi.</p><p>so the first question, for Craig and Abi, we all have different backgrounds and skillsets. everyone is zero. It has, because it's going to be really hard to find someone that has studied, in college. so there's no single Shiro profession, role, is not in a single defined role there.</p><p>so what overall advice can we give our listeners? to get started with zero and improving their skills. Wants to go first. </p><p>Abi Hough: [00:01:25] That sound that over to Vista Sullivan, I think. </p><p>Craig Sullivan: [00:01:27] Can you give that one to me? We did chat about their side BNI and there's both broadening and deepening your skill set.</p><p>so it's a fairly common treat, to see that really good CRO people are what. We call T-shaped and they have some tremendously fantastic specialisms stuff that they're really super bad, but they're also good or very good, a lot of other things. And it's this combination of disciplines and perspectives on too.</p><p>Designing and improving and experimenting with products that actually, fills in a lot of their sort of gaps in your knowledge. So in order to, to do this work really I think it's fairly well accepted that you need skills in multiple disciplines. You don't necessarily need to be an expert in all those disciplines.</p><p>So yeah, there are many different types of CRL people who specialize in different areas, but broadly it's about getting wider knowledge, but also deepening. Knowledge in the areas that you really enjoy and people end up specializing, not in what they think is the best, but they tend to specialized in things that either Ghouta B they're quite hard to master.</p><p>So there's a challenge involved there. and basically, so there were some incentives there for them to then study that thing more deeply. And the third thing is that they actually enjoy. Way doing it. it's no fun doing a CRO, a discipline or a specialism.</p><p>If you don't actually enjoy it, that area of work. So you have to experience a lot of various of work to learn, but you also have to experience lots of areas of work to find out what you're really passionate about. Yeah. Yeah, </p><p>Abi Hough: [00:03:11] because if you don't have the passion for the topic, then you're not going to do your best at it.</p><p>And, I think finding one thing or a couple of things that you really enjoy doing, then that kind of shines through in the work that you're outputting as well. so it's really important to find those things that float your boat, so to speak. I think. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:31] Yeah. so hopefully you're already have this passion.</p><p>Yeah. That's going to be a hard, there's no course to develop the passion. I think, but when we, prepped for this, this session, we did. Came up with a list of at least some inherent traits that we think people should have. and then we see, see, most hero people. And these are these an errand trades are things like, bravery, passion, creativity, determination, humanity, the curiosity, and to be sociable.</p><p>and this is all in addition to the soft and hard skills that you probably can't and learn. and think the most important one is that we, defined in terms of hard skills were experiments, design analytics, psychology, and, qualitative, qualitative research. in addition, of course there are a lot of skills, like you just said, Craig, there's a T shape here.</p><p>So it, it can be a lot of skills that you combine here, like copywriting, data visualization, Most of us as some, have some basic understanding of each MLC is as how browsers work. And then there's the soft skills of communication, presentation, storytelling being user centered, caring about what users, think and how they experience things.</p><p>Craig Sullivan: [00:04:41] You see the, and there are all these, people there's maybe a prescribed pathway, but there isn't, and some of the best CRO people I've met have cross trained from other disciplines. Who've been great UX and they've got into experiments or they've been a really good visual designer, but they got into analytics.</p><p>But the things that these multiple disciplines do is no, you can start to understand why people can or can't use products, but then you can actually begin to measure the impact of that knowledge. So it's this capability to triangulate problems by having. a wide range of skill sets allows you to use more toolkits and inspect the problem from different angles and it's those angles and that perspective that make you better than somebody who's just a single discipline sort of practitioner.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:30] Yup. And, so again, tell us a bit, maybe Abi started with you, what are the latest skills that you tried to develop? </p><p>Abi Hough: [00:05:39] You want me to be brutally honest? The latest, the skills I developed was how to homeschool and nine-year-old,</p><p>actually, I say that jokingly, but in order to teach a nine year old, six months worth of schoolwork, I have to. Do a lot of improvement in myself. For example, I had to throughout how to store retail really well. There's no point in just sitting in front of a nine year old and saying, we're going to do this today.</p><p>So yeah. How to sell it into him. So that improved my skills. So I had to learn how to make the most out of, minimal materials, everybody panicked bite. So the stuff that I needed to homeschool him. It wasn't available. So making the most out of, a limited budget or limited resources or helps to go towards optimizing.</p><p>And it sounds really odd, but. It was probably the worst six months of my entire life. I'm very glad he's now back at school, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:44] a lot of crazy Devacy you need a lot of bravery determination, </p><p>Abi Hough: [00:06:49] the sell into probably the hardest stakeholder you'll ever have to deal with. This is a very strange year.</p><p>I'm sure for a lot of people and I wouldn't have thought I'd be saying, here's what I took away. And this is what I've been learning over the past six months, but honestly is it's opened my eyes. And the thing that I took away from it is. You can improve being a CRO, not necessarily because you're sat down doing all the things that people are telling you to do, but from an outside influence on a situation that you were put in, you can always learn to optimize that in some way.</p><p>And it's having that mindset to be able to flip a situation so that it works for you that I think really adds to making a good CRO. I don't know what you think, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:36] right. Yeah, what's the latest skill you develop that Greg? </p><p>Craig Sullivan: [00:07:39] I had to a couple of things with lockdown again. I ended up running a plant project where I had to basically grow on, deliver, or leave for pickup.</p><p>Plants for a 659 plants to people in the local area who couldn't get them at garden centers during lockdown, or they were isolated. So I had to learn how to, forecast exactly how much yield was going to get out of the plants I would grow. So to have enough. Talk to satisfy the demand. So I ended up having until, yeah, let know all about selfless forecasting and stock planning and sewing stuff at the right time.</p><p>So I had to learn how to run like a miniature garden center or a nurse. And through that work, I also got involved with a lot of locals businesses in lockdown who had no it skills at all, and suddenly had to set out websites and get stuff running on platforms like Shopify. So I helped a few of them and that was.</p><p>Completely outside of my comfort zone, they don't have big budgets and big companies and shiny offices and you're working on a shoe string and that has to be ready today. So yeah, those were another couple of great lockdown skills. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:52] so a lot of opportunity and in a global pandemic.</p><p>so we just messaged a big list of skills that you need to have. or that you could at least try to develop and then you need to have some sense of. Okay, where to start, what to pick and you need the Mo after motivation and ability to do So could you guys give us some of your favorite picks or approaches to learning a new subjects and how to develop this growth mentality?</p><p>Craig Sullivan: [00:09:18] I think it's a realization that we work in such a fluid and dynamic environment that. Knowledge that you see is current right now. If you were to freeze my knowledge right now, within three months, it started to go out of date within a year. It would be horrendously out of date. So standing still, or having the same pile of knowledge after a period of time, just isn't an option it's changing too much.</p><p>And we must also learn to do things in new ways to automate things, to use machine learning tools as our friends and solving. Problems. That will be one of the challenges that we have in future. But I think there must be a realization. I cannot be an expert in all of this, and your knowledge can only be augmented as well as the network of people that, So my best piece of knowledge right now is not loads of cool stuff that helped conversion. It's knowing what I know and what other people know that I don't know. Cause I can go and ask them. So if you ask me a question, I know precisely, no, I have no idea, but I know a guy who does, and that piece of knowledge is infinitely more valuable than either trying to cram everything into my head, which is impossible or become an expert in all those areas.</p><p>So knowing the extent and boundary of your own knowledge is perhaps the ways. Piece of knowledge of all, because then you're not stepping outside that that you can leave your ego at the door and ask them or help and say, do you know what? I have no idea what to do here.</p><p>I'll go and ask. So and and they will have an answer. So that is true, really important than network of friends and compadres and people in CRO we'll determine a lot of your success. I would say. </p><p>Abi Hough: [00:11:00] Yeah, I would agree with that. And for me, it's definitely, networking and meet ups, provide the biggest benefit for me because I can't be on social media, 24 hours a day, or reading the latest podcast.</p><p>She'd burn out quicker than you can blink. but. By going to meet ups and just speaking to other people in the industry, it gives you the opportunity for them to say something like, Oh, did you hear about X, Y, and Z? And you're like, Oh no, I didn't hear about that, but I'm going to go and find out about it.</p><p>So it was just, it's like a filter that allows you to learn new techniques and theories that are coming through and what everybody else is doing. so that's a great way of doing it. And also, you can speak to people about. What's not gone right for them. You're not just hearing all the glory stories about how wonderfully somebody has done your hair in the nuts and bolts about how things didn't go so well and how they fix the problem.</p><p>And you can be aware of things to look out for yourself. So </p><p>Craig Sullivan: [00:11:55] for me, go ahead. There's all the usual things to mention, obviously like reading books, blogs, there's a lot of really great stuff on Mitcham all of the engineering and experimentation teams that very big company. &nbsp;published blogs on Mitcham, there's on the job practice, but, if you're already working in this industry, try and work with other CRO people or other companies.</p><p>Cause you'll you learn, you think, Oh, that's quite good to, I'll have to put that in too. So it's great. it's a, for another people is for stealing all our best ideas. But it's how you approach this in a matter where you can look at everything that everybody's doing and then try and actually pull out the things that really.</p><p>Help you in your specific area of work there isn't one answer. There's only you a problem, and a set of tools to inspect that problem. That's all there always is. Right? And every problem is a unique, but I would also see going and speaking and getting over your fear. I'm. Always terrified of speaking like five minutes before I'm just like car, I'm shaking, Oh, everybody thinks, Oh, that looks dead easy and he's calm and everything. No. It's quite nerve wracking. And for those of you who haven't considered, because you think it's nerve wracking. everybody else has nerve, so you're no different. Take the plunge, get a go meetups, create some material, what some other talks meet your own stuff.</p><p>And then you can practice on the circuit because becoming a speaker who was under the best things that I did, because when I started giving away my knowledge, I got so much back. I give away the more people give me an return and that's a good lesson for all. Sierra is if you all, don't your knowledge, tightly will.</p><p>It'll just. And with her, Whereas if you give away your knowledge freely, then you'll establish a huge network of people who will make your knowledge pool even bigger. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:45] Yeah. And some people now might as, okay. Maybe I want to speak, but I don't know how to start or where to go. Abi , maybe you're a great example in this.</p><p>Your first public session was at CXL life. so how did that happen? </p><p>Abi Hough: [00:14:00] it was, I think somebody called Craig Sullivan may have just suggested I did it. Yeah. So I'd never done any public speaking at all ever. And, I'll be honest with you. The idea of a trip over to the States sounded like a really cool idea at the time.</p><p>but I was absolutely. Petrified. and CXL live massive conference within the industry. And I just said, yeah. Okay, I'll do that, but I've never done any public speaking. I was absolutely. I'm not going to say it, but I was very nervous. but I got over there on the fly and it was all fine.</p><p>But for the two days to my speaking slot, I basically wanted to come home. I was so scared, but what I did get away from that was the support of all the other speakers and the conference organizers who were absolutely amazing. given me a Lego kind of confidence. Yeah, you can do it. It's great. and I did, I got on that stage and I did my 15 minute talk.</p><p>And from the entire time I, I thought my tongue was going to drop out of my head and I didn't know what I was going to say. And it on my, I couldn't speak properly cause I didn't have any water, but the talk went really well. And I got a few laughs out of it, which is what. I wanted to achieve.</p><p>And I also got to highlight my passion, which is quality assurance and making sure stuff works right before we rolled it out. And how important that was along with checking websites for errors before you even start optimizing them and how much money you can make from that before you begin an AB testing program.</p><p>And. It's not something that I regret doing now. I was very grateful for the opportunity. I had somebody shame me to go and do it, even though it was so far out of my comfort zone. I'd have never </p><p>Craig Sullivan: [00:15:51] contemplated. We want to encourage people to go and try and do this. You'll be surprised if you do a talk.</p><p>If you get video, you write to conference, organize and say, look, I've got this really important thing to say. here's some details about it. Here's maybe a video of a talk I've done before. Even if it's one you've recorded at home, that's fine. You'll be really surprised that there will be open to sharing your idea and you won't find out unless you actually try and to get over the nervousness of public speaking.</p><p>Yeah, almost every city and every town in the world has an organization called Toastmasters or something similar. And these people's jobs are to teach you how to, do a speech at a wedding or something like that. And honestly, these guys will coach us a really good talk overview in a few weeks time.</p><p>So there's a top tip. If you want to learn how to get over that thing of public speaking, do your first thing or become even better, go to Toastmasters and get them to help you. </p><p>Abi Hough: [00:16:48] And my two top tips would be storytelling. It makes it so much easier when you're doing a presentation. And the second top tip would be, don't be afraid to, take the piss out of yourself for want of a better word, because adding humor into it makes it human.</p><p>If that makes any </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:06] sense. Now, meals, we also got a comment from anime class and, Greg pushed her to talk at super week, but everyone starts contacting a crack for four talks. You can just go to Toastmasters or go to medium.com. There are a lot of local meetups on there, or any kinds of topic.</p><p>Craig Sullivan: [00:17:25] Measure camp had a whole session. Last time we had a physical meetup that was all about on how we could encourage greater diversity in the speakers that we see at conferences. And that was fascinating. And there's a lot of things that we can all do. If we built alliances to meet that better. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:44] I also got a question from my Elysia.</p><p>She asks on the topic of, of, speaking engagements. what, if you feel you have nothing new to say in the talk? </p><p>Craig Sullivan: [00:17:55] I think if you're curious and interested and you pick that curiosity by exposing yourself to lots of other things that people are seeing, I go along and watch talks on stuff.</p><p>That's way beyond my skill level. I'm like, and people ask me, where are you watching that stuff on? Predictive modeling, using Markov chains for I'm like, wow, it's really hard, but it makes my stuff feel rubbish. and so by exposing yourself to lots and lots of talks and interests and things that people are talking about, believe me, it will give you ideas for your talk.</p><p>Cause at some point when they're talking, you'll think, wait a minute, that isn't right. And then some loyalty to you where you have to get up and say it meaty. so it's way of tricking yourself into fight, dig a of material so that you do have something to see </p><p>Abi Hough: [00:18:41] that Mary's always, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:43] yeah. And my way of thinking about this, there's also that, especially when you go to a conference, when there's multiple tracks, you just announced the topic and then people show up because they want to know more about this topic.</p><p>otherwise they wouldn't come. </p><p>Craig Sullivan: [00:18:55] There's a whole that runs in the U S that my friend, Michael, all guard works with. We'll try and publish the link to that for the help with coaching, a lot of, up and coming female speakers, lots of initiatives like that going on, where people are trying to, help, increase the amount of interesting stuff that we're seeing.</p><p>And it's working already long way to go. But getting better, but yeah, please, if you have something to say, or you can develop something to say, please say it, the world wants to hear it </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:26] back on the topic of, of the skills you need to develop. There's a lot of skills. We just mentioned a lot of them, a lot of ways of, of, Improving yourself speaking engagements and will be one of them, but say you come in a situation that you really want to know more about a specific skill.</p><p>Maybe it's not Mark of change, but, but maybe machine learning or you see something fancy, from a fellow, a general practitioner. You want to dive in yourself. How do you generally approach learning more about that? Would it be you just started reading courses, doing courses, doing blogs, or do you start doing speaking engagements?</p><p>Where do you, where would you start? How </p><p>Craig Sullivan: [00:20:02] would you books and courses CXL has some wonderful stuff. And, I have a course on their disclaimer, but there's a whole range of stuff. Statistics, every single angle of experimentation is probably covered in the material. So there are very specialist, one there's also.</p><p>Very good general training sites as well. We'll offer stuff. copy hackers, do some free, copywriting training on their website, which is really cool. and I highly recommend 'em, mobile coal prices, copywriting course on CX. it's very good and lots of other people think so. but books, yeah.</p><p>I've ordered myself a whole load of machine learning books and PIF and stuff recently, and I'm plowing through them and it's mightily confusing and very hard, but I'm learning some stuff. I was doing some testing for a site, so I just ordered myself. Tons and tons of machine learning books.</p><p>And they're sitting there on a pile, nagging me to read them, So I've started reading three of them. It's tough going. it's like chewing on old dry cardboard or something, but you gotta, you've got to make time and force yourself to carve out time in your life or some development because otherwise your skills are gonna atrophy.</p><p>You've got to have a certain percentage set aside. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:18] Have you ever questioned that for you? from the chat from, Tim Stewart? of course then being Tim, it's not a single line question, but, </p><p>Abi Hough: [00:21:25] and I move, we got </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:28] Tim talks about, okay. People underestimate the non-zero skill part of, of being a CRO.</p><p>So Abi , how much would you say, how important is that? How much time do you spend developing the nuns? The non traditional zero skills? So we, we spoke about. experimentation design, psychology analytics and growth research. let's call that the arts art skills. How much should we focus on soft? </p><p>Abi Hough: [00:21:51] I think that equally as important as the other skills to be fair to you, the issue that I see is we're selling in a complicated industry to any new business, right?</p><p>some, a client who's never heard of CRO before. you have to be able to sell in the process, what the aims are. it's not just AB testing. It's a whole plethora of the elements that we're looking to optimize. So for me, having the ability to. Explain that clearly and how the process is run and what the results are, what we've done and, breaking down the silos.</p><p>So communication to me is actually one of the biggest skillsets, that you can work on in terms of a soft skill. And just realizing that the people that you're dealing with the. They are people as well. They have problems. They've got stresses. </p><p>Craig Sullivan: [00:22:43] And </p><p>Abi Hough: [00:22:44] the better that you can, the better that you can speak to a client just on the same level.</p><p>It's we're all trying to achieve the same thing. So having that awareness that the people that you're dealing with they've got their own problems and pressures and being able to relate on that basic human level. To try and get to a point where you're all trying to get to is one of the most important skills that I think is a CRO.</p><p>You can have, nobody's out to prove somebody else's better than the other person, or, my test is better than yours and your task was a fail and all this kind of thing. We're all just trying to get to one place. So if we can communicate together rather than having a competition about everything or trying to prove a point.</p><p>Craig Sullivan: [00:23:29] There's a simple, there's a simple philosophical way of thinking about this as well. We expend all this energy and time and data and research, trying to understand the visitors to this client's website. Right? Why aren't we using our CRR skills to understand. The client and their business, right? And this is the mistake.</p><p>This is the gear gap. the relationship false into common mistakes are where you just deal with one person in the company. But I bet you've never met anyone else, or the rest of the teams or any of the stakeholders. They're just invisible people. Behind this one content, are you really getting under the skin of the business?</p><p>Do you know how they work, how they tick? we have a massive kickoff checklist of 150 set of questions. We try and ask in the first couple of weeks of the client, try and get answers to, because we realize if we don't understand those then soft skills that we apply to our base on the wrong foundation.</p><p>So expand it using your CRO scale. To understand the client is just as important as the visitors to the website. and you have the skills there to figure that one out too, if you're doing the job. </p><p>Abi Hough: [00:24:45] So empathy is the word I would use. Not only for the users on the website, but for the people that you're dealing on the other side of the wall as well.</p><p>Craig Sullivan: [00:24:54] Yeah. I think my three point plan is shut the fuck up. Ask really good questions. Listen, repeat. That's it. I remember there used to be a TV series in the year. Okay. they had this guy who was a business troubleshooter and he would go in and just ask people loads of annoying questions, but the business and the stock and the lead times and cashflow and everything else.</p><p>But at the end of it, you would be able to work out. You've got a problem here. You're carrying too much stock. If you cut it by this and get this warehouse here, you get an extra million pounds of revenue, every year, right? And I always used to love those kinds of programs. It's questioning and listening that gets under the skin and gets you the information that you need to then figure out what it is.</p><p>You're optimizing. It's a business you're optimizing, not a website. So understand the business, not just the website. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:48] Yep. Final question for both of you on, in the, a really short answer. Cause we're almost out of time. so who or what has taught you the most useful things since Euro? </p><p>Abi Hough: [00:25:58] Oh, okay. Mine will be quick.</p><p>So people, humans, any kind of human you can think of, because my view is if you observe people using a product, you're going to know how they use it, what problems they've got with it, and how they react. Interact with stuff in the real world. And it's only by observing people in their natural habitat.</p><p>If you want to put it that way, that you can figure out how you need to solve a problem. so for me, it is. The users, the end user at the end of the day. Yeah. That's the biggest influence on me because it never surprises me. In fact, I'm always surprised on a daily basis about how the general population, you something or interact with something.</p><p>And it always raises an eyebrow because I learned something new every day. And I think how on earth. Did they even think about using that in that way? Yeah. Massively affected my approach to what I do with regard to QA. That's why I'm quite good at it because their mindset is now instilled on my mindset.</p><p>So that's why I generally get a really high hit rate on. Yeah, AB tests and things, because I'm thinking like, standard user rather than CRO person. </p><p>Craig Sullivan: [00:27:15] So it's an ego thing. if you do enough experimentation. My thing that I learned was 18 months moderating use of tests in the lab, often of my own stuff.</p><p>I used to get angry, like they were being critical of my work. and once I got over that, I realized it's not about me. It's about the user interface and them, I'm there as an observer. I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with what I designed and that realization eventually is you cannot be a perfect designer, such a thing doesn't exist.</p><p>There are only users, your design and validating that it works. And then you try and plug that gap took me 18 months to learn it. But it's a really important lesson. It's not about you or your personal feelings or your colleagues' opinions or what you're. Boss thinks it's about the users and the product and the behavioral change.</p><p>And that is all amen. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:07] If you have any questions, the last four for Greg or Abi , the zoom chat will probably close if we end the session. but as we can probably continue on Twitter as the hashtag #DigitalElite20, and we have Abi at @WTF_UX or @OptimiseOrDie for Craig.</p><p>Craig has a free audit checklist for Google analytics coming out in two, three weeks in the works for the past five years. they're gonna fix all our problems.</p><p>and we have, of course, we have an upcoming us urography podcast session with, Abi . we're still discussing the topic, but it might be something, inspired by the Netflix series on the whole everyone's striking everyone, or maybe some top reasons for QA fields. We see, we'll see what happens.</p><p>Maybe we do two or three. And if you want to, make sure to subscribe at cro.cafe/subscribe. thanks everyone. thanks for joining Abi . Thanks Craig. And I hope you enjoyed it.</p><p>‍</p>",,f86dbd7d

Welcome back to the cafe. And for those that missed the first Dutch episode with you, can you give us a short introduction of your journey into CRO? </p><p>Ruben: [00:01:33] Yeah, thanks for inviting me again. you know, always a pleasure to be here. so my name is Ruben . I work as a conversion manager, at the online dialogue, CRO consultancy.</p><p>And, I've been doing this, CRO for over 10 years now. I love the combination of psychology data making impact, but also helping people and organizations in CRO. I've been working as the CRO manager here since September last year. Before that I was the head of CRO and UX Sanama, which is one of the biggest publishing companies in Northern Europe.</p><p>Guido: [00:02:06] So you switched from client side to agency side. </p><p>Ruben: [00:02:09] I switched to agency sites. </p><p>Guido: [00:02:10] Yes, I'm experienced now </p><p>Ruben: [00:02:15] actually very good because, a lot of diversity, a lot of smart colleagues from which I can learn even more again. And I have the opportunity to help more organizations and, helping and, making people enthusiastic for experimentation and validation is something that, is one of my biggest passions and it gives me energy and I love joy.</p><p>So. Good. Good to hear. Yeah. I hear a </p><p>Guido: [00:02:36] trigger for this podcast or prompt if we a, wants to say in a BJ Fokker terminology. Well, your article on LinkedIn. Yeah. and we'll link to that in the show notes, with the title out to motivate your organization to adopt CRO. And one of the lines in that is that, what was your trigger to, to ride that and, your experience with, doing this with, with multiple companies.</p><p>is that you say we need a thousand times more focused on, organizational change thousand times. That's a lot of Ruben. Tell us why. </p><p>Ruben: [00:03:09] Oh, of course. A thousand times it's not evidence or fact based. What I try to make clear with the line </p><p>Guido: [00:03:15] is this could be 999 times. </p><p>Ruben: [00:03:17] Exactly. It's something around that number.</p><p>Now, what I tried to try to say with that line is that. We as CRO specialist, we need a lot more focused on motivating the organization and really setting the stage for experimentation and validation. we know so much as CRO specialist, we know that over 75% of the releases on websites, results in a notebook verse changes or even hurts conversions.</p><p>we know what's your own maturity. It looks like we read about it in blogs and presentations who knew our linked in. Does it have booking? Does it. Microsoft other great companies, but still I see so many CRO specialists and teams struggle within organizations. They're somewhere in the corner, in the back of the, of the organization doing their AB tests, but not really motivating the organization to depth the mindsets and the depth of the culture of experimentation and validation and to be successful in our line of work.</p><p>I think that is vital for us. </p><p>Guido: [00:04:13] No, so basically there's this weird gap between what we work on with the websites. And how we work with the organizations that we work with it. </p><p>Ruben: [00:04:22] Yes, indeed. And, I think it's, it's, it should be part of our jobs. And a big part of our job is to teach the organization and to change that culture and the mindset of organization, but it's hard and it's very hard, but as CRO specialist, we already know quite a lot about it.</p><p>Actually, </p><p>Guido: [00:04:38] we should be able to do this. </p><p>Ruben: [00:04:39] Exactly. We know a lot. We know we have the mindset, we, we know how to change behavior because he did constantly and daily on our websites. now we need to use that knowledge and use that in our organization. </p><p>Guido: [00:04:50] And in your blog post, you mentioned you created a small model, to do this and, partially based on also including a system one versus system two, to implement this.</p><p>So how can, how can we use system one system two to do, to help us do this, with an organism? </p><p>Ruben: [00:05:06] Well, actually system one, assistant two is of course where, where the struggle begins, for the listeners who. When I was familiar with it's a system. One is our primal brain, our, our, our brain. We have, for many years already, it's our instincts, our reflexes.</p><p>And it's the strongest part of the brain rule thumps at 95% of our decisions and choices are made with system one system two is our rational brain and it is the brain. It can reason it can think in past present and future. It can think if I go to the gym now and keep it up four or four months to come next summer, I'll have a six pack.</p><p>A matter of saying, but this is system one system two is where the struggle begins a cost, system two knows what's good for us and what we should do, but system one is not, is more focused, is only focused on the present. so for instance, we want to go to the gym. you have this plan in your head.</p><p>If you go to the gym three times a week, I'll get fit, for well-trained body. but when the time comes, when you have to go to the gym, you started with that conversation in your head. Well, you know, it's good for yourself to go to gym, but it's raining or the bear stays pretty nice or yeah. Already </p><p>Guido: [00:06:12] cycled to work.</p><p>So basically our already did some exercise. </p><p>Ruben: [00:06:15] Exactly. So, so behavioral change often feels okay. Cause it could be because system two doesn't know how to change. It doesn't know what to do. It could be the system. One is not motivated enough. it's more motivated in the here and now to do something else.</p><p>And most of the times it's a struggle between the two systems </p><p>Guido: [00:06:32] and basically the system one also wants to preserve energy, right? And that's, that's in those thousands of years revolution, that's what it's, trains and learn to do. There's not enough food, should be careful with that. It should be very careful at what I spend my energy on specifically with exercise.</p><p>That's it's usually hard to do. It takes a lot of energy. </p><p>Ruben: [00:06:53] Yeah. Why should I do that now? Exactly. And that's also a, what I've mentioned in my blog posts, which we referred to it. There was a research that was really shocking to me is that even in life and death situations, we have a really hard time to change.</p><p>And that's because of its struggle, </p><p>Guido: [00:07:09] an example from a former medical field, with people being diagnosed with a terminal illness that could be fixed by changing their lives. </p><p>Ruben: [00:07:17] Yes, exactly. It's it's patients with clots arteries and it's, that's a serious condition. It's really. Painful and scarred starts getting more painful when it results in an early and painful death.</p><p>which is horrible. It's absolutely horrible. but a doctor said that people can, get rid of the pain and gain, have a healthy life and grow old. If they change their lifestyles though starts, starts doing more sports, stop overeating, stop smoking stuff, alcohol, less stress, and more relaxation in their lives.</p><p>Yeah, so live a healthier lifestyle. And if those patients do that, almost everyone can survive. but research shows that only 10% survives. It's a very liberal change is dead heart at evening life and death situations. we are horrible at changing and it should make us think because we as zero specialists and data analysts want to change the mindset way of working and the culture of an organization though.</p><p>In order to realize that it's something you should take serious and therefore the line we should spend 10,000 times more. At time on organizational change, </p><p>Guido: [00:08:21] usually buying something online or trying to change an organization into doing more experiments. This doesn't really sound like a life or death situation.</p><p>So the score will probably be even worse than just 10% converting to actually do it. </p><p>Ruben: [00:08:36] Exactly. Exactly. So it is, it's a hard challenge and, but it is fight all four for our success as a. As CRO specialist and data analyst. </p><p>Guido: [00:08:44] And you're a model, are you a, you talk about basically three elements, three parcel form where you can implement changes.</p><p>That's the physical environment, social environment and rewards. so can you take us through those, let's start with the physical environment. What can we do there? Yeah. </p><p>Ruben: [00:09:00] fiscal farm is of course, very well explained in the book nudge. we can change behavior for tweaks in the, in the physical environment.</p><p>So in a, in my, in a conference presentation, which I gave a couple of weeks ago, I gave the example of something I did with, within the company. I worked at five, six years ago and I was the first year a specialist there. And, I had to set up experimentation, work and process within the company.</p><p>There was just one problem. The company wasn't even data-driven yet. But they had a huge amount of data. So what I did, the tweaking fiscal environment, I got a monitor and it placed it at a spot at the entrance of the company. And everyone had to pass it Andrews, at least six times. You have to pass it to go from one side to the office, the other side.</p><p>And you go to toilet. When you go to the cafeteria, when you leave the office and I placed a monitored air with a live Google analytics dashboard. So. Then it's three advantages. First of all, you see data at least six times a day. Yeah. And because it's a life, their sports, these numbers flesh because they update constantly and what flashes draws extra attention.</p><p>Second, there were different product teams and product owners who were responsible parts of the website. So I showed the page views or at each of those sections on the website. So I created some sort of internal competition because if you will, faster data screen and you see that you get the most space shoes, of course you would start bragging about it and teasing yours, your colleagues a little bit about it.</p><p>So it was a fiscal tweak with, with a social component to it. The third one, it was the first, the third advantage was perhaps the biggest one is that visitors also saw this dashboard. And then we get the nice bias that if we enter company and we see data being shared, we automatically assume that the whole company is data driven.</p><p>So all the meetings with Facebook there started with visitors, notifying that we are so data driven, including the, the meetings of the board of directors. So the board of directors possibly heard several times a day. Wow. It's so cool. How your organization is so data driven and that you share data with placing a monitor and at a spot where everyone sees it.</p><p>As to tweaking the fiscal environment, which resulted in people being more data driven and making it easier for me to set up for rate optimization, </p><p>Guido: [00:11:14] marketing merges have suffered, and the Sharon for AB testing has been impacted too. If you want to keep that thing to enterprise standards, but safe, 80% on your annual contract, you can consider comfort, but there are similar release you can take advantage of full stack and hybrid features, strong privacy compliance, no blink.</p><p>And enterprise great security feel good about your smart business decision in Fest, what you saved back your CRO check out the www adult's overbook slash 22. That's basically you start at the end with the showing the notch grasses, and hopefully one will become more than I did. I have a similar experience, although I did.</p><p>Get some backlash in the sense that, well, you can just, you can just start doing this without even having a perfect data because the monitor also incentivize people. So to think about, Hey, but this, this data point it's not correct. Or it's not actually showing the real value that we should be open to mind or something like that.</p><p>Thank you. Okay. Yeah. That is true. We know this, but we don't have this data yet. So let's do something about that. So it can spark a conversation, but it can also be a bit tricky that people think there are, they're more data driven, more, more data capable than they actually are. Yes. So you see them feed them using numbers that, and they use that in certain ways that.</p><p>Well, I've, I've, I've sat at many presentations, I think. Okay. You're using data, but that's not actually what the data is saying. </p><p>Ruben: [00:12:50] No, exactly. I fully agree. </p><p>Guido: [00:12:52] Love like your creative interpretation of the data, but </p><p>Ruben: [00:12:56] no, I fully agree. And I think, Marianne from a two group set as well. And in this podcast, you have to, you have to be careful with, with, what kind of data you show.</p><p>But, but, even if they use the wrong data, they do use data. It's the same as, yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:13:09] It's a starting point. </p><p>Ruben: [00:13:10] Yeah, exactly. It's just, it's the same. Do you, do you try to change an organization? You, you get resistance and resistance. Isn't good, but it's still involvement. Yeah. So it has to start somewhere. But coming back to that, I think we have to use that experimentation mindset in our organizations, within change management, there are a lot of models.</p><p>like I said, Marty on his express stage was excellent. He showed the six steps. We know the eight steps from John Cutler, which is a very famous book from mid nineties. but it works different than every organization. These steps are basically actually it's expert opinion and best practices. And from our AB tests, we know that's not that doesn't result in a most winner, so we should use difference.</p><p>Tweaks and methods and seeing our organization would work if desperate works for your organization, use that. If it doesn't try something else, </p><p>Guido: [00:13:59] maybe it's an email, a daily email you need to send out or </p><p>Ruben: [00:14:02] exactly, exactly, or have a host of competition on which test one and half the F a, if the charts hanging somewhere in the office so that everyone sees it, display the science of a B test and that people with both States on which, which will win.</p><p>you can think of several reasons that to tweak the fiscal requirements, but. Do experiment and, through, see what, what resonates the organization, what works in your organization? What it doesn't </p><p>Guido: [00:14:26] exactly. And just get started, right? I mean, I think people like us tend to be a bit careful in this and that's okay.</p><p>But the data isn't perfect. Jazz. Yeah. Or we can run with both can, I'll be a proper AB test that we can run within the organization. We have, we have physical constraints or we can also split the mem and proper groups or something. but just try these things. You'll, you'll see. Yeah. How things pan out then, and hopefully, the change is big enough that you can see a result without having the actual numbers.</p><p>It's significance to show that </p><p>Ruben: [00:15:02] I, I totally agree with that. We, we, I mean, when you have to experiment to see what works in your organization, right? What doesn't, but some things, will most likely work are proven as well by, by science. And I'm one of those it's it's you need to find proof. Yeah. I mean, if you cannot prove that they beat testing works for your organization, then you can mention that that LinkedIn does it and Microsoft does it, but will not resonate.</p><p>so if you're a one man army. A one, one zero specialist organization just start doing as many of the tests as you can learn to code if you're too dependent on development. Yeah. Because you can use that as a proof at works. And again, you can play nice games. You can show it in presentations. You can make people guess which test won.</p><p>but proof definitely is one of the things that will work and you need. Changed organization. </p><p>Guido: [00:15:49] Yeah. And then, like I said, just, just things like a dashboard or something like that, showing them, the current status of things do do spark conversation and then a bit of, hopefully a fun, fun, yeah.</p><p>Exercise or, or challenges between the teams. as I see what the numbers are from the other. Team, that does work </p><p>Ruben: [00:16:13] out. Yeah. As we mentioned, do a test experiment. What she show, what daddy is show. I mean, it might be different from higher management compared to your direct colleagues and that as well for higher management.</p><p>If, if, if your management is, if the salary is dependent on 95% on bonuses, For instance. Yeah. They probably want to see more business cases and winning tests and a percentage of revenue of conversion revenue uplift. Whereas maybe if they are not. So the on bonuses, and this is just an example of maybe wanting to be more involved within the experimentation process.</p><p>Yeah. Maybe you have to test the idea. So it works for every organization, but, but like we said, we should spend more time with it and do gets targeted as soon as possible </p><p>Guido: [00:16:56] and sort of, sort of physical, like for environment, try to try to, change things there and then social environments, I think we dipped into it a little bit already, but </p><p>Ruben: [00:17:04] yeah.</p><p>Yeah, of course. as as mentioned block, am I in my presentation, social environment is also something we of course know from our work as, as conversion specialists, We we've seen our AB test. We've seen it on, on many websites, rev, ratings reviews, testimonials, they changed the behavior of people.</p><p>so do think about how you can use that within your organization. get the people who are enthusiastic together and host brainstorms together, have for lunch and learn together. come up with best ideas, a hypothesis, start a community. Get people together and, involve people. And again, how it ends organization.</p><p>And you have to, you have to try it out. But we know as covert specialists that that's social proof, social validation, it works. We know the community building works. and I know that people change their behavior. Once they're in a community </p><p>Guido: [00:17:54] show, show all the works show with all those y'all doing, that's basically a basic social proof tactics.</p><p>Ruben: [00:18:00] Yeah. Yeah. And what I really liked what I also said in my presentation. one of my clients, especially since the converse specialist there, Sasha, I think you know her as well. Yep. Yeah. At the end of every AB test report, he shows the names of the colleagues. And as course of the, which test one competition.</p><p>So this is really smart because it sets us up social norm, because if all your colleagues are scoring points a year are nuts. You will definitely participate next time or try harder to, to yes, the right test winner includes for loser. Yeah. And it's also a very smart way to set with a small tweak, set the strong social norm to get people more involved and more thinking about what you're testing.</p><p>Guido: [00:18:37] Yeah, we did. We also did, at the hotspot where we have where we ran test and we, we just, we let the person that came up with the test or executed the test and let them present instead of someone, from zero team. Just us doing this. It's a whole team effort of people in the countries that run the test or think of these tests.</p><p>And that really works. Yeah. </p><p>Ruben: [00:18:57] Yeah. That works really well. indeed has gift people with stage and to present, but also for yourself as a conversion specialist, we know from very basic psychology , that likability and authority are, are very important. So be humble and, help people instead of. Once I see a lot of, of times happens when, when a colleague comes up with a test idea and we are like, okay, is this based on data?</p><p>Is it based on user research? No. Okay. Well, we'll put it somewhere in the back and at the bottom of the test backlog, and we'll see, we'll notify you when we test it, which will then never happen. we also tend to say to, for instance, UX designers from, okay. Now from now, we're going to experiment, did everything.</p><p>So you're not allowed to put your designs straight away a life anymore. And that doesn't work. You have to be nice. You have to be likable too, to get people to follow you. Instead of saying, this is not some, this is you're not allowed to do this anymore. You can also reframe it as Hey together. We can improve your designs.</p><p>And instead of saying no to two ideas based on gut feeling for people who want to get started with experimentation, do test eyes, those ideas for wants, because if you hear a no from someone, when you try you, you put effort into it and really try to finally start experimenting as this converse specialist keeps telling you and you get a no for your test idea.</p><p>Yeah. We're not going to get people on board. Yeah. You're not going to motivate people. So from a social perspective, also look at yourself and be likable and be in authority and to help people and help her be humble. Yesterday's brainstorm was so good. I really liked step's idea of running </p><p>Guido: [00:20:35] that test on the call to action </p><p>Ruben: [00:20:36] buttons, making them orange will </p><p>Guido: [00:20:38] really make them stand out.</p><p>Don't you think? Yeah. Right. Do you want to design real AB test winners and achieve enormous conversion uplift, then stop, brainstorming and take a scientific approach. If you can read Dutch, follow the steps and online influence the best seller men, even book Delta now and ruling the authors course and become an expert in applying proven behavioral signs yourself, go to &nbsp;dot com for more information and free down notes.</p><p>Often when you start, especially with, designers or marketeers or, developers, you're not the, the usual environments we work in. It says hero specialist. when you start out it's to those people that feels like either you are taking their, their work, it feels, it feels very personal. or it feels like you're giving them extra work, like, okay, we've gone on design AB test.</p><p>So we need an hour, a couple of variants, for the, the thing you were already building. But now we want that times two, three, four. So it feels like that feels like a lot of extra work while actually, if you, if you frame it a bit differently, you say, okay, but. Instead of designing this or developing this whole new system, let's start with an MVP.</p><p>Let's, let's start with a smaller thing where we can, but still big enough to validate, whatever we want to, validate and, and, and take it from there. And then actually after a couple of months, they started realizing, well, actually it just saves a lot of time, especially for developers. I think it saves a lot of time.</p><p>If we start out with small things, Part of their demo. It's actually another walking. So let's not start this building, this whole mess of thing. That's going to take us three months while we can also just spend like three days validate it or it doesn't work or make it better or whatever, but whatever the path is, but it can save a lot of work too.</p><p>Ruben: [00:22:26] Yeah, exactly. So, so always, have people, give, give the feeling that people are still in control themselves, get some autonomy, because they don't like to be taught what to do. We don't like that. No one likes that. and make the change as small as possible. so don't be too harsh on them when their statistics aren't perfect.</p><p>Don't be too harsh on them when, when their test idea is not based on, on a, on a research or scientific research, and trained us people, those were antigenic trained and bring them together in a fun and engaging way. So. Make a change small and give them a sense of autonomy. Otherwise they're, they're just gonna, it's going backfire.</p><p>Guido: [00:23:02] Yeah. Are those people creating that content instead of, &nbsp;not attacking, but it feels like a taking their, whatever. They come up with it, you couldn't, you can ask them like, okay, what are your biggest unknowns about what you're making? What are the biggest doubts that you have about your audience or your, your, the content that you have?</p><p>Or the biggest audacious things that you would otherwise never do, but what, what would you like to do, but you don't want to, or can't because our brand guidelines or whatever, and help them, you know, bridge that gap of knowledge, with, with doing your experiments or use a test or whatever you use to validate, and help them in that.</p><p>So they, they start seeing, Hey, this actually helping me. </p><p>Ruben: [00:23:39] Yep, exactly. Exactly. </p><p>Guido: [00:23:41] So the third morning you're in your model is rewards. </p><p>Ruben: [00:23:45] Yes. Yes. I'm divorced. There were very mixed evidence, for death. if the parents were plan rewards, of course. what I really liked is, research by Steve Tonka, which you mentioned in his book explanation works.</p><p>they already actually did research on rewards and maybe this is more of a management thing, but if there are clear rewards, people start experimenting more. When I, there mine are mixed signals. So you do say like, Hey, experiment more in your, assessments about your work, your evaluation. You mentioned that the uplift is not high enough, that will backfire, but rewards being celery from motion, busted assessment complement, that sets people can help people to start experimenting.</p><p>and of course this is more on the management level. Those rewards. But it's a converse specialist. We can also have fun with different words. Like for instance, when someone, the best test idea gets a cake or, or, the one who wins the waste test one competition gets a, gets a bottle of wine. yeah.</p><p>Do see there is these rewards as trying to start building habits. </p><p>Guido: [00:24:48] Yeah, exactly. So then like, like Tom says in his book, it's more about rewarding the process. That actually rewarding the outcome because that's, that's more difficult or it will change over time or you'll have ups and downs. We all know that.</p><p>but it's a process that you want to, to motivate people to do it. </p><p>Ruben: [00:25:05] Yeah, definitely do focus and motivates the, the, the process. if you look at goals, the goals can be useful. but, in formula one, everyone is to call to win, but there's only one winner. Yeah. So it's the process that makes the difference.</p><p>Guido: [00:25:17] Yeah. And that makes people more motivated. I think if you give that gay or whatever, to the person, that's just sending one idea and that's by accident. I had had a nice effect. there's not a going to be motivating to the person that's sending 20 ideas, based on research, that happened through North panels, all of them, but, </p><p>Ruben: [00:25:36] yeah.</p><p>Yeah. Try to combine something people want with something people have to, which something people have to do. And if you think about advice fee, if you, for instance, give a cake, it's the reward. But if those colleagues are nice, they'll share it around with the, with their departments, which again is to tweak in a social environment.</p><p>Guido: [00:25:52] We already see companies doing this or rewarding people, actually rewarding people with, bonuses or, or, in salary or whatever they do to reward people in there. Quarterly reviews or yearly reviews. You see companies doing that. </p><p>Ruben: [00:26:06] well, other than, than the companies, we're all here about in, in, in the presentations and the blocks.</p><p>no, I don't see companies doing that yet, but I hope that hope companies will do that. But, but to realize that we do again, need to spend more time on organizational change and to motivate people, to start having this as a culture and a mindset. Yeah, </p><p>Guido: [00:26:25] exactly. anything else you want to add? on the model?</p><p>Ruben: [00:26:29] Yeah, I'm, I'm actually thinking about adding a fourth layer and it's, it's something, a fourth, besides the fiscal, the social and rewards, and is basically, the, the four environments. So a ruling, we, we see it now with, with the COVID-19 crisis. I mean, due to rules set up by the government, we are all of a sudden able to change our complete lifestyles.</p><p>Yup. and again, isn't, we're on a management level probably, but, if you said the ruling that, so that for every sprint you need, at least one experiment, of course, people starts, changing their, their behavior. but I think the model as it is now, I think it's, it's, it's a good umbrella to start a discussion within organizations to, to start wanting, to have more focus on organizational change and likes just the one assistant to.</p><p>It's a, it's an easy Malo for something that is extremely complex and extremely big. but it does give a great understanding and I think it works. Like I said, that's an umbrella to start generating ideas with your team. to come up with, with ways to, to motivate the organization, to the depth of version, rate optimization and experimentation.</p><p>Guido: [00:27:35] Yeah, no one, no one can ever say, Oh, but that's too big of a change. We can never do that. No one will ever adapt. Well, do you remember COVID-19 </p><p>Ruben: [00:27:43] exactly, exactly. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:27:45] The whole world. </p><p>Ruben: [00:27:46] That is very interesting. it's very interesting time from a behavioral science perspective and, online dialogue. We have several psychologists.</p><p>Great fun. Having discussing, seeing what happens, and all of a sudden we can change </p><p>Guido: [00:27:59] all of a sudden, a lot of things change. Yeah, </p><p>Ruben: [00:28:01] exactly. Exactly. </p><p>Guido: [00:28:02] So, well, thanks for explaining the model, to us. so what, what are your working on the next couple of months? Any new courses or, </p><p>Ruben: [00:28:12] yeah, I'll, I'll keep making courses.</p><p>as you know, like I said, at the beginning, I love helping organizations and people. And with online dialogue, I can help a lot of organizations. and in my </p><p>Guido: [00:28:22] people that don't know, you have to two courses all new to me, right? </p><p>Ruben: [00:28:25] Yeah. Yeah. In my free time, I like to create, courses which help people to get started and Excel in conversion rate optimization, who don't have to huge budgets to pay for expensive business to business courses.</p><p>and I really liked it a lot. I liked doing that. I get a lot of positive, feedback from people all over the world. You, benefit a lot from, from my course reluctance, but that's what I like to, what I will focus on is, is, is in the coming months, is this our to summit to sum it up in three points?</p><p>I really think we should use our knowledge to, motivate organizations and we already have a lot of knowledge. I think we should spend more time besides experimenting on, on, on motivating organizations. And I think are actually, I know that besides having it, I think plan and a test roadmap, we should set up a roadmap for changing the organization, put it into calendar and evaluate with the theme, brainstorm with the team and experiment, what happens and, what works and what doesn't work.</p><p>And this will be my focus. I will focus more on this in the coming months, years, and then write more about it and, Yeah, explore more about it and help people, hopefully, and organizations with that </p><p>Guido: [00:29:37] sounds like a very good ambition for just a couple of months. </p><p>Ruben: [00:29:43] It's going to be years. I think it's, it's something we have to do to get her as well.</p><p>yeah, if more and more organizations start adapting this mindset and as culture, we do realize a big environmental change, which again helps audit organizations. To, to adopt it and, and to thrive in CRO and get more. Authorization at the majestic and to be successful in our line of work for everyone, we have to do this and you have to inspire each other and help each other doing stuff for </p><p>Guido: [00:30:11] over 10 years.</p><p>And now online dial-up advisors about evidence-based conversion optimization with a focus on data and psychology. We see that analyzing data and recognizing customer behavior results, online dialogue with your clients and a higher ROI that team of strategists, analysts, psychologist, specialists gathered valuable insights in online behavior stars.</p><p>And together with you, they optimize the different elements of your zero program through redesigned expert reviews, 80 desks. And behavioral analysis for more information about their services, go to Oman dialogue. I'm a firm believer that this is the core problem. Why most SEO programs fail? Why, why agencies feel or internal Ciro?</p><p>people feel is, is because of this. They, they weren't able to get their colleagues or management. buy into this. </p><p>Ruben: [00:31:05] Yeah, no, I agree. And, and we, we see it now as well. And, and this crisis, one of the, one of the teams they've got cut is in some companies is conversion optimization, which is weird because there's so much research that if you invest in growth in time of crisis, you'll do great after the crisis.</p><p>so there's still, we have so much knowledge. We know so much, but as we start off, there's still a problem there </p><p>Guido: [00:31:28] exactly answers. And now it's specifically, there's a lot of behavioral changes like we just spoke about. So th th we need to figure out as a company, I need to figure out what is changing exactly.</p><p>What are the changes, priorities for my customers? What are they. feel about this, how are they acting differently and is specifically the moment that you should invest in this? </p><p>Ruben: [00:31:47] Exactly. And we can help with that. We can do the research and see how behavior has changed, and we can help our colleagues with that.</p><p>We can help customer support if they get too many questions ready to go with weekend, we can make changes on the website. for people to get the right information so they don't have to call, we can help our colleagues. So again, yeah, help people, be humble and in that way, motivate them to start experimenting validating.</p><p>Guido: [00:32:09] Now, if you're listening to this and, are a bit inspired, hopefully, to, to learn more about this and there will be, a video from Rubin in the, in the show notes and also include, the books that he also added to his, There was an article on LinkedIn and there's five books. you already mentioned the, a couple of them, their switch, from chip and Dan Heath.</p><p>They're thinking fast and slow from Daniel Kahneman. our, our Shiro Bible. There's a dry from Daniel pink. There's nudge. From Tara and Sunstein and there's atomic habits. And before we started, you already said, okay, you want to remove one and add another? I don't have a limit of five, but sure. Let's go with that.</p><p>Why do you want to remove one? And which one? </p><p>Ruben: [00:32:50] No, no, no. To remove one, if I have to keep it to five, I'll remove one, but let's make it six for now. I recently finished a, the book, the science of organizational change. Okay. from Paul Gibbons and he looks more at a scientific. proven methods to change organizations.</p><p>it's a long reads and he does like to, showed up other writers and models are not working. so that makes the book a bit lengthy. But the theory that he explains that that work from a science based evidence based. Those give great insights in what you can use, for your organization. So if meant, if I can make six books, then definitely add that one as well.</p><p>Guido: [00:33:30] So, so when you say it's, it's, it's a long read. So how long is </p><p>Ruben: [00:33:33] it </p><p>Guido: [00:33:35] an enormous </p><p>Ruben: [00:33:36] yeah, 330 pages, I think, but </p><p>Guido: [00:33:39] that's fine. Let me, let me have a quick look. three 17 mine, according to Amazon. It should be fine, </p><p>Ruben: [00:33:46] right? It's not an easy read. I bought switch, which is my favorite book on this subject. And most of model is based on switch.</p><p>It's really easy and nice read. I'm thinking fast and slow, which a lot of people have read. And this one, the science of organizational change is a bit harder to read. So if I'd say choose one book to switch, start with that. </p><p>Guido: [00:34:04] Those books are usually include a bit more storytelling. Right. That makes them easy.</p><p>Yeah, </p><p>Ruben: [00:34:08] exactly. Exactly. The good thing about those books of based on science is that there are a lot of notes at the end. So basically it's not 300. 79 pages, but there's 20 pages of notes and references to scientific articles. So </p><p>Guido: [00:34:21] I also liked that, with, Steven experimentation works, right. There's a lot of science based things in there.</p><p>Although I think his book. I mean, he also works for ultimately, and that's quite obvious when you, when you read the book, there's, there's a lot of Optimizely examples in there, our clients in there, and also a lot of, and also booking is highly featured </p><p>Ruben: [00:34:40] the book chapter on booking. Indeed. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:34:42] If you remove all the ultimately and booking things, I think you end up with half the book, but it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a good rate.</p><p>It's a good rate. </p><p>Ruben: [00:34:48] Exactly. No, I agree. I like about a book and I think we should grow to that, as, as a, as a CRO community. Is his experimentation outside the website. Well, you also mentioned like tell efficient screens in waiting lines and such experimentation in Olympic gold winning seal teams in the really one team.</p><p>So I liked that about a book that he also mentioned his experimentation besides our websites. And I think that's something important as well for us. </p><p>Guido: [00:35:16] Yeah. I, I really love that. that was basically the study that I did, applied cognitive psychology is. That didn't do anything with the line was all about offline, a nudging and an experimentation, and it was really fun.</p><p>And it's also what I like when you go to a, for example, areas or, or buildings that are very well thought out or, are, airports, and casinos. </p><p>Ruben: [00:35:41] Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:35:42] Yeah, those are two examples of the rent, a lot of thought in the design and in, because there are a lot of people there that might not speak the language, so you can not do.</p><p>Basically anything with, with a language you need to have a proper symbols for things. the, we find in there is very important, Durham airport to find your Gates the fastest way to do that boards. And so, so ceilings and. floors are our aim to help you, do that. And, cause he knows actually, try to keep your insight as much as possible.</p><p>if you've ever been to. Cause he knows there's not a lot of windows there won't be, there won't be any clocks, </p><p>Ruben: [00:36:18] no things like that. If you want examples of great physical tweaks, go to an airport and try to spot the ball. </p><p>Guido: [00:36:27] That's a yeah. Try that. Will thanks so much. And we'll include the old books and the links that we mentioned, the insurance, and, I would say good luck, with, with trying to implement this, I hope to hear and read, read more from you about this topic.</p><p>And, we'll probably talk again soon. </p><p>Ruben: [00:36:44] Yes. Thank you for your time. Thank you for having me. </p><p>Guido: [00:36:46] Thank you.

My name is Guido Jansen. And welcome to the book where I showed you the behind the scenes of optimization themes and thought with their specialist about data and human driven optimization, and implementing a culture of experimentation and the better in case you missed it.</p><p>In the previous English episode, we spoke about copywriting for conversion, the jolt cleft key. You can listen to that episode zero K website pouring your podcast. As you're listening with polite now. This episode is made possible by our partners online influence Institute, content square covert.</p><p>SiteSpect an online dialogue. Welcome to season two 36. Great to have you both back in the cafe and let's start off with our definitions. What's the difference between service size and hindsight's testing. </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:01:07] if the client's like testing is fine site, the source, like testing and service. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:11] Okay. So let's explain to the client and the surfer for those who don't </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:01:14] to make it really basic with blindsides.</p><p>you almost always get a tool like optimize to PWB tasty, where if a client side solution replaces scripts, on your websites, mostly in the hat. And when you experiment way run AB tests, the script of your test is being loaded on the browser, on your website. Pfister where as wanting to serve her sides, you need to play some scripts on your server.</p><p>And your test runs on your server. also codes you bill for your variation is noted on the server, which means you're one up, see a flickering effect for instance. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:48] And, Tom, what will be the, distributional service that's first client site does that you guys currently perform at? Or mind dialogue </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:01:55] question?</p><p>I think 80, 20. So 80% client sites, then you would send server-side. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:03] Okay. So what are the biggest differences? when making the choice. Okay. We have this experiment that we want to run. We have our, both CS and now we come to the stage. Okay. We need to decide, if this is even possible with client side testing, which is often already available.</p><p>Or do we need to go further with this and do something that's more on the service side do and maybe even implement the tool for that. so how would that decision process go? What are the dependencies? Yeah, it's </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:02:31] of course we need it badly Fest. You want to run, but basically all it's tarred with, checking the maturity of the organization within perverse rates optimization experimentation.</p><p>if you're just starting off with lawn CRO specialists and a lot of development capacity, if any. then investigators do client side and you have more easy tests. Whereas if the, if there's more mature organization, more mature, if it comes up question for redesigned tests, backend test pricing tests, the answer is definitely easier and better way to go.</p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:02:59] And it's also, you are in a better position in the organization, I would say. So when you start alone is zero, especially the STR most of the time. There's running desks at your own. And besides is, there are still a development team was doing a lot of development stuff and that's never tested actually.</p><p>And when you have the opportunity to do circumcise testing, you can actually test all your releases as well. And that's, I think a good thing because then you can really see what the effect is for all the stuff you are building. Yeah, but that's mostly for more mature organizations, I would say. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:33] Why would you say that?</p><p>So why is it more for mature open, organizations to do surface hides, experiments? is it more expensive or does it require more expertise or </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:03:42] not sure if it requires more expertise, but I think that the organization needs to be ready to test everything. And I think that's something different, right?</p><p>Because like normal organization, it just build to off, they think they know how, Customers will react to staff. They think they know that everything they build we're actually as value through the physics of the website, but that's actually not the case. And I think when a company is ready to test everyday and to, yeah, to do actually, yeah, be ready to do this everyday.</p><p>And I think, the client side is more of a starting point or fell CRO and AB testing. And so our side testing is most of the times becomes later in the process of the majority. </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:04:25] Yes. Love to see it that, if you start off, let's say you're just starting off with the client science, so you can have your first AB test up and running in one hour.</p><p>And you just need to base the script on your websites, which is like five minutes for a developer. And you set up your first test. If you do server sites with more people needed, maybe there's also illegal and I should be in full. So there's been more work to get it started. And so therefore the answer is yes, on for, for, experimentation should be a bit higher before we start cervicitis </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:53] sounds a bit like, you're saying that with service side, you can test everything while with client side there are limitations.</p><p>Is it also, is it truly the case or are there also scenarios where you can, are there things that you cannot test service or that you can do client side? </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:05:08] Good, not a service I think into clients. And now I would say no, it's mainly with server side, you can run more complex beds, like test algorithms, orders and checkouts.</p><p>especially the checkout change, the order of that. big features, product testing, that's possible the server side testing clients like testing. There are some hacks, but it's fairly difficult. And if not impossible, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:30] can you give us some examples or maybe experiments that you guys did that were not possible client side, but that you, needed to implement service?</p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:05:37] Yeah, actually prior to this skipping, the shopping cards glides, right? So when someone's on the products page, they click on a bicycle and we just wanted to move in, bearing into the checkouts because the average products for all animals really low, I live with more than one. So we thought they just need one product.</p><p>Why do you actually need to show up in cars? So we want to do the client sides, but what happened on the background was that the people who are actually visiting the shopping cart, but you didn't saw it. So it was like a big load I'm on the back on the back of the loads. I've never, still. I think the shopping cart and also that they went through the checkout because it's not possible for insights or actually remove that stuff because it's built in because, so we tested this and we saw that again with when you saw the experience of the visitors in the variant, it was actually really bad.</p><p>So we go there. This was actually useless. Yeah. so now we're trying, we're going to try it again, but then serve so you, yeah, for really false load with the IB, actually skip the staff and then you can actually say if it's really influence behavior. So I think that's a. Good example one Oh one I have is that, for example, a new navigation with S with one's a clients, so navigation on the whole over and all the websites.</p><p>And did you want to do with blindside the low diagram gumbo? a longer. So we test that server sides and then actually you saw no difference in load side, then you're going to really make sure that the difference in behavior, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:02] you're saying that showing in addition to being able to test different things, or at least more things with, with the service side, there are also additional benefits, like low time.</p><p>are there any other additional benefits with destined serve side </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:07:17] another example, which matches your question is braces redesign. you have a, companies, websites that's pushing a redesign live straightaway without testing it. it makes sense because I've never seen it happen. I've never seen the work blind sites.</p><p>I've seen a lot of tries and efforts, but it never worked blindside. Whereas, if we a server sites, you can test the whole website, you could even test different backends, to validate your redesign. so I think that's another big advantage and something you should do when you do redesign, you should test it server side.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:07:48] And I know that she . So I talked to a bank and they didn't want to implement a client site. Maybe they're still in the minor hating, let's say. Because the developers are getting a bit nervous and security departments that actually you use that actually do great the service sites too, because he just said, otherwise, I'm going to implement the client side.</p><p>And they said, no, we're going to do it because all the client's information again. Yeah. Go to the tool. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:19] Yeah, because basically what you're doing with clients site testing, you're placing the average script cookie that is usually out somewhere else. So basically someone else, while you can, technically, you can host it yourself, but most of the times that's not ours, how it's done, how it's implemented.</p><p>So you embed a Jabra scripts from somewhere else from VWO or Optimizely or whatever tool you're using, which is then loaded in your, in the browser of your customer. And yeah, you don't have any control over there JavaScript. technically they could change it. And if they have a security issue in their code somehow, and someone can change that maybe, even a deck in the middle and change that to alpha script.</p><p>technically they can do stuff on your website. That's you might not want, or as a bank. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:09:01] Yeah. Or they get access to the data. </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:09:03] Exactly. And then again, there are different rules again, for wherever the server is the testing tool. Where did in Asia or Europe or United States? so clients are definitely legal.</p><p>also has a say </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:14] marketing bridges have suffered. And the sheriff for AB testing has been impacted too. If you want to keep that thing to enterprise standards, but safe, 80% on your annual contract, you can consider comfort, but there some release you can take advantage of full stack and hybrid features, strong privacy compliance, no blink.</p><p>And enterprise great security feel good about your smart business position, infest what you saved. Becking your CRO program. Check out the www adults over slash 2020 while the, I think since I'm over a year. Browsers are more and more vigilant than in removing cookies or being more strict in using cookies.</p><p>Is that a additional benefit for serve sides or does they'll make a difference? </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:10:03] No, definitely. With service side, you place a so called first party could piece. whereas with client sites, you place a third party cookies, like you just mentioned, and, browsers are a lot more acceptance towards first party cookies because you have the data for herself and you don't have it with some third party.</p><p>So definitely that's a Bethany big advance as well for service side </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:10:26] in the future to give me more, I think for different browsers, maybe it does now. I think Safari's doing it and yeah, you will not know what happens in the next year because privacy's yeah, God was more and more important. I think.</p><p>And I was saying that is, I think also that, if you build that service side and it has a positive result, it's, it should be really easily implemented because you're already built that there's it's a part of the GMs or the actually what actual websites. So it would be one personal or both then to actually implement it.</p><p>That's not always the case, but, we see some problems with companies that they that's a lot, but there's problems with implementing winners. And this should be raised here with whichever side. And that's a good thing </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:09] because it already exists. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:11:10] Yeah. So the clients side is actually.</p><p>it's actually far off the website. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:19] Would you say that also means that it usually takes longer to build surface side experiments, because you actually need to build it and make it fully functional. Whereas on the client side, you may be able to cheat some things, be able to validate your hypothesis, but not actually build the functionality.</p><p>The way it should be built. but, maybe take some shortcuts there. So </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:11:42] eventually that festival no easy, desperate clients' sites by ISTE set up. And if you have a limited knowledge, some base models on front end development, you can do it yourself, but it's a desk that's bigger and on Sarah's side would be a, the more easy way to go.</p><p>I don't wanna say you have to build such impossible hacks, which not always work. so the best little size of a desk </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:02] and, in your experience. So would you say that Glines side that's also less effective usually on average, compared to serve shutters because you can do more elaborate tests on side?</p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:12:14] Yeah, I actually would say so. I also think that inclined site testing, you also have the figure of figuring out which also going to be at test itself, Loaded the experiments a little bit later, then default </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:26] for those that don't know, I hope everyone knows, but there are, and maybe you haven't noticed that the, with your tool so good on you if that's never happened, but.</p><p>often tools that lost clients are low. If the connection is a bit slow or the browser is a bit slow, or I don't know, you have a very slow computer with a, and your CPO CPU is overloaded. It might happen that you just load the original page. And the other script kicks in a couple of seconds later. Or maybe if it's really horrible, Then seconds later or even worse.</p><p>And then the, the variance appears, or changes the page or whatever is your, a variant. And that's obviously not a good thing, and that's not something that happens on service. </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:13:07] Exactly. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:13:08] And I think, at a type of days you can do like price testing or releasing products and actually that's what the impact is.</p><p>I think that's yeah, more connected to the business companies are doing then some of the easy line site testing, Sales on competition are doing. Of course you can go mind boats, or you can maybe have one thing for example, is doing still decline site testing, which is easier for example, to also improve your website and small steps, but also use service testing for the bigger stuff.</p><p>That's also an option. </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:13:36] Yeah. And I think if you have server side testing, you can test the bigger stuff. And I think more and more people will be start to get interested, within the company for experimentation. Because she starts touching the products or the real, the value proposition or algorithms.</p><p>and I think those big, impactful tests, only you to perform those, you get more and more people at Suggestic within your company to start experimenting or at least see what's going on and see the possibilities of experimentation. so yeah, secondary benefits of service testing would be to get more people on boards, more colleagues on board.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:10] So are there a sort of the tools that you guys have experienced with, or that you see emerging in the market? Would it be more, tools that are integrated in the CMS that people are already have, or maybe even in the analytics tool that they, have service sides is hard, those AB testing tools, experimentation, those embedded in that, or are they're all.</p><p>separate tools that you, install in addition to what you already are. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:14:33] I think before that are two, types of companies. You have one that actually wants to use service testing also to encourage people to test more, but they actually build the O'Toole whether UI on it and they want to make sure that every product team is really started test.</p><p>So you get an overview of how many tests are running and what the win rate is and everything. And they, the, I spoke to a couple of other smaller companies and they actually only built the technology. So Dave has server side solution with no UI. It's only like technical stuff, but they just wanted to build it because it's the desk Ardon way better.</p><p>And they confessed everyday. And it actually started with a question like, I want to test my search algorithm a versus B. but I can't do with blindsides. So vinyls builds the solution ourself and it actually was way easier than I think the only loss. They actually use that solution to run all the tests now.</p><p>And there are some other companies who are, yeah, just using it to make experimentation bigger in the company. And they actually build a whole too around it. And they also integrated the analytics part. But if you start it easy, you can, yeah. You can do the analytics still in the own analytics, in the Google analytics, for example, or another week.</p><p>And just connect those with the server side solution. You have </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:46] the AB testing part, whether you do as client side or server side, it's not that complicated, right? You just need to be able to, divert your traffic. in a decent split between the variants that you've set and do that, in a decent random manner.</p><p>but so server-side tools are all they exist for a long time now also, but I think w we can, it's a fair assumption or fair statement that the client side tools were very popular last 10 years and are a bit more mature than the service side tools. so you guys been experimenting with, server site tools more and more.</p><p>Is that a fair assessment? are there already things that didn't serve size that you cannot do or not yet do or, like usability issues that you see there? Are they indeed a lesson? </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:16:33] No defense there's organizations can either choose to build for themselves with your IRA without UI. I use interface, but schools like AB testing, optimizing.</p><p>I also have their solution for server sites with their grades. Do I, with the experience they have from their client's site tool, but still with service sites, you are as if you're a CRO specialist, you're probably more dependent upon development. then you are, when you've been, we built test flying site, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:57] what kind of skills would you need in addition to running a test on clients?</p><p>Because if you run desk, client side, you already need to know a bit of HTML, CSS, JavaScript. so you're saying that's not sufficient to do that, to run an experiment service, </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:17:12] Server side, actually a code into the original code of the website. So the fancy and what language your website is written.</p><p>I need to know deco, which could be a bit more difficult than the basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript or jQuery if you prefer. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:17:26] Yeah. And it can also be harder to find someone to actually be part of the team, because from that diversity, you just need to find one. Then they actually can all build the best.</p><p>But if you have a specific boat used on your methods or decode language, which is hard to use in Holland, for example, and it's really hard to find a developer for building test. And then maybe you asked too, but they also building a lot of other stuff. Then it's hard to find someone where actually it's going to help you build an AB test </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:54] fondant developers are way more common and there, they all know HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p><p>Almost a while back end can be that this is a very diverse landscape and the kind of languages that you need. So you're pretty, you're probably needs a for service at Dustin. You probably need the developers that actually build the website to also make your test show you're fishing in the same pool of resources.</p><p>As say, as the rest of the company, while for client sides, you might, you might be able to do it yourself. Or it's fairly easy and relatively cheap to just, get a, get an outsider and to build the test for you. </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:18:29] Yeah, exactly. And if you are a zero specialist and build plane sides, I think you can learn front end development in couple of hours, maybe two days.</p><p>Yeah. It's not that hard to run a basic tests. if you decide to do the small and medium complex tests yourself, and you can learn it in two days and get the complex test of development, whereas if you go to the service side, you always will probably need to developments if you are a zero specialist, but I see also see with clients that's that dependency, the betterment is increasing ones.</p><p>websites go to SBA single page application. So for instance, reacts angler, it's harder to test on those blind sites tools. Don't always work. so that's another reason why you should, yeah. Good move to server side testing. and again, more and more dependent on the betterment in that case.</p><p>Anyway, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:16] SiteSpect offers a worldwide unique AB testing, personalization and product recommendation solution. SiteSpect works the service sites without any tags or scripts, which guarantees and ultimate performance, the size Ellucian eliminates delays and the chance of bickering effects. And this approach also ensures that the current and future browsers, skirt your rules, like you feed them eat.</p><p>Don't make an impact on your AB testing and personalization. Have more info visit &nbsp;dot com. You've helped companies, while doing dope and doing those experiments, but also implementing, the service sites, tool sets. What are some common mistakes or roadblocks that you see with companies, that are implementing surface experiments?</p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:19:59] I think that many companies think it's really difficult to actually build the solution. I spoke to one company that actually discussed, that they want to set this up. Like we should go sheriffs, like those thing, are you sure? And they made all like the pros and cons and discuss a lot about it. And then they started it.</p><p>And also three weeks there at the basic version in life. And off the six weeks, we just have one developer, our once a year, a specialist, they actually have like a. Yeah, pretty decent service side solution ready to actually be used. yeah, I think ServerSide's also, actually at the vendors. They, a lot of people don't know a lot about the, the service side solution, like the marketing guys at the vendors, they all use blindside and server side.</p><p>Also. It'd be, I think it's as a gyno. I dunno, name or feeding that is really difficult, but what you thought would be better for us? It's actually not that hard. So yeah, our advisors would also be to just start using it. I started actually building it and see iceberg. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:54] So w what you always, so those tools do I always.</p><p>so the more common tools that offer our service sites, testing, do they always work with different kinds of, programming languages or does it all depend on the programming language that your size is built on? </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:21:10] I haven't run into those problems yet. I wouldn't exactly know if it runs in all languages.</p><p>I would assume it does own the most popular </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:16] languages. If it doesn't then of course, then self built will be probably the best solution for you. </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:21:22] And start let's start, like Tom said, start easy. Just, start with the technology itself. Maybe not yet the user interface and from bearing you can, they can keep on building and then started user interface, get more data service side.</p><p>you can start off easy with just the technology </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:38] when talking about the technologies and vendors. of course there is that while we already mentioned, AB tasty, isn't a solution, a PWL full stack Optimizely full stack. Of course we have SiteSpect as a solution. which is a bit different.</p><p>I think, SiteSpect is a proxy server or the intercept methods. so they put a server between, your website and the customer, for serving out those different, Varian's I think &nbsp;has a, solution for this, But w when I was researching Dell solutions, I came across difference, different definitions of server, side testing.</p><p>I think some of the, referred more to a hybrid model. technically, if you are an, a client sites, AB testing tool, all of them also offer a split you're out testing, and you could argue that is also a form of service sites testing, the actual variants. you just use a, the other script to point your users to different solutions.</p><p>So that might be some kind of a hybrid method. so what are your favorite technologies or vendors for doing this? </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:22:43] The question that I, first of all like that, like the splits, your role, like resolving, to each other before you started recording, there are some hacks you can do at client sites, which.</p><p>It's then kind of service, like for instance, for refreshing brands, I wanted to test algorithms, for recommenders. So we basically had two recommenders on the product page one on display, none one on this way, block blindside, they beat us with a simple CSS change. We switched them around. So we showed the other recommender and the way we test the algorithms, that isn't a kind of nice heck.</p><p>but for tools I have, I don't really have a preference yet, but I've seen some good </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:20] solutions. Yeah. I also did. I think it was five years ago, 40 algorithm. There was this, when I came on board, they already volunteers, algorithm running, to optimize the category pages and the tool allowed for, basically testing one algorithm versus another.</p><p>So you could, you could test them those, but they didn't have an sort of, was already built in and it didn't really have an option to turn it off and actually. That's the algorithms against doing nothing. And I think I judged, I just used a, the client sites, AB testing tool just to basically rip out the algorithm tool, to do nothing, to disable it and then run that against each other.</p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:24:00] Yeah. The funny thing lady, we did some, I did some research on it was driven on different companies and we actually found out that most companies are building it themselves </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:08] as in your clients, the, </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:24:11] and some of our clients, but also these companies we're actually using or considering service side and mostly.</p><p>Most companies actually develop this solution internally instead of using a, one of the defendants we just discussed </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:26] on the one hand they will, that would indicate, okay. It's actually quite simple to do it yourself. So maybe that's so good at it. On the other hand, I would say that it still sounds a bit inefficient, right?</p><p>It should. why aren't there server side solutions. that I can just pull off the shelf and implement for my company. is it a technology issue? Is it, are those all really expensive to do? Or what do you think is causing this? </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:24:47] Yeah, I think the actually just building the solution can be quite easy, but then of course you still have some maintenance also, to actually keep on using the technology. If you build both yourselves. So maybe just start up, can be really cheap, but then you also have maybe one developer. actually you're maintaining your own solution. And if you ever blind, or if you use a tool for that, maybe you've made it for the tool, but you don't get the maintenance.</p><p>So I think it's kind of balance between those two. I actually, yeah. Find out what's the best solution. And maybe also the cheapest one. That's the thing somewhere in the middle, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:24] depends a bit on that, on how you're organized development sites within your company, if you can basically do one or the other.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:25:31] And again, that also depends on the goal. if your goal is to do service side with elements that then their own solution will, probably be doable to build just the technical part. Did you want to do a if wants, allow it for a lot of people in the company to use &nbsp;product teams. then, using a vendor which has the technology already a good user interface based on their experience with clients sites and data implemented, or they have to full solution, but it costs more money.</p><p>where as you can start off with yourselves as technology, like we mentioned, and then build from there, build, using face, build the data. So it's also a choice of </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:26:09] the goals. Yeah. By the way, the, those questions from, the most common mistakes and the favorites, the technologies, those came from one of our other podcasts guests.</p><p>He posted those questions in our Facebook group. And if you want it to be, be more involved with, other Ciro specialist, you can go to chiro.cafe/facebook and ask you a question. those are upcoming, upcoming guests. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:26:29] Can I add one thing to the, to a discussion we just had? I think. A couple of companies actually told us that it's cheaper to build able solution themselves then instead of using a tool.</p><p>So I think that's a, especially to companies, we just built a technical solution, so they don't build a whole year around it. They just use it from a test server side. And I think also if you look at the defenders, for example, sites back, they have a lot of knowledge about service like this thing. And they're actually, they do it for a long time already, although it's not the same exact same solution as the others.</p><p>So I think they are a little bit better. And it's also into actually used in their marketing because I think a lot of people actually at the fenders, they don't know a lot of our services testing. It's mainly focused on clients. So I think they can need to step up their game as well. Although they are pretty big some companies and I think optimized, for example, it's really focused.</p><p>I think it's good. They can still make something movements. They are actually show how to do with how easy it is. I give more information actually. So you use cases. And that's maybe also yeah. Majority, which need to grow on that kind of stuff. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:27:38] What'd you say that, in terms of data quality for your experiments, or is there a difference between client side and server testing, which is it's so is there any benefits for growing server-side?</p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:27:47] So if you, do everything right server sites, then you get </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:27:51] promoted. </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:27:52] Of course, that's always there. Important that they've said about everything, And there, I can give you more trustworthy data as its role data coming from, from the server instead of if you send it to Google analytics and make sense of it.</p><p>so I hear about cases where a suicide data is more trustworthy than clients, </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:28:08] that data </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:09] for over 10 years. Now, all my diet of advisers about evidence based conversion optimization with a focus on data and psychology. We see that analyzing data and recognizing customer behavior results in a better online dialogue with your clients.</p><p>In a higher ROI that team of strategists, analysts, psychologists, and UX specialists gathered valuable insights in your online behavior of your visitors and together with you optimize the different. So if you're a hero program through redesigned expert reviews, AB test and behavioral analysis, for more information about their services, go to Owen dialogue.</p><p>Yes, sir. You're not missing out on anyone. That's blocking alpha scripts. Yeah, </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:28:49] exactly. But then still you have all the raw data and then you can need to make it analysis around this. So the bad thing, or the negative part can be that you actually rebuilding your analytics to Nexstar yo who had X, which already have, and then you have your own server side solution, which are analytics tool that you're actually selling kind of products or your website, It's not like you are a kind of vendor for products. I think you need to be. careful with it as well. Otherwise you spend a lot of development time and people on actually. Yeah. Building stuff, which is already out there. Yeah. So it's a, yeah, I think the data going to be better, but maybe even with Garfield, with it rebuilding your analytics solution, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:27] open stores, tools out there on GitHub that people can just pull off the shelf and then try to implement it for the wrong company.</p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:29:34] Facebook has the open source. I've had a service sites. I'm not sure about any others right now. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:29:40] I'm not sure if it's. Open source, but split on iOS as a free solution. It's not open source, but usually you can also use for sharper side. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:48] I'll do a quick Google. Yeah, I come across Facebook and there's this wasabi.</p><p>Have you got, </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:29:57] yeah, I've heard about that. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:59] any, things that you guys are working on right now to make sure for science experimentation better to make it better, but you guys run a lot of experiments. do you need to rebuild? I know you've guys built, automation for, for experiments, saw the whole jar.</p><p>event lately with, Tom sharing things, how he, automated, the reports from experiments, with air table. Is that something that you now completely need to rebuild? when you do a service side testing, or is it something you can also reuse </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:30:29] and we can still use that. especially if he doesn't make the analysis in the tool or your builds herself or from fender, but if you still use your ethics, so usually for debts, that actually doesn't change.</p><p>I think once you do most of that, mostly now, is that the discussion with our clients, if it's actually, they should, we should, they need our analysis. because I think lo time becomes more and more important and nowadays. I think Google was also, yeah, focusing more on that. So you're actually results and Google are influenced by a lot of them with your website.</p><p>And if you put a lot of scripts on it, it actually becomes slower. And the experience we thought was better for the Vista we use server-side so there are becoming more and more volunteers or actually doing it. So that's why we also start to discuss it with our clients. And it depends of course level yeah.</p><p>Stage of maturity. Also the maybe divergent diaries and, the status of CRO or AB testing inside the company. So it's been more and more discussed. Actually let it last months, I would say called Barracuda four or five years, I've worked on that before. So that's a kind of a development for that way.</p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:31:32] So the best way helping, clients, choose the tool, and find the term together. If the client side is sufficient for now, or they switch to server sites and how they should do </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:31:43] so for new clients or clients that are reevaluating their bedroom, are you more and more recommending service either, or maybe even only recommending service side by an hour?</p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:31:53] I would say so. But again, it depends on the maturity appliance. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:31:56] Yeah. Yeah. Or it's a culmination. So some Fest we're doing service sites, which are a bigger, more important for the company, for example. And we're still testing line size next week. Oh, it's actually a funny story. I heard lady, when y'all have Shiro D made her flight scientist and there's a developer building test and it uses you, your own mindset issues too, as like between 20 and 30% of the experiments is positive.</p><p>But when you start having server site testing, you're actually gets thoughts of different developers. And they are used that Darko is always going live. But now it's actually tested. So then they see it as a 30% of this working. So they actually throwing 70% of their code away and that's not really good for their mindset and, I'm motivated.</p><p>They get, so we are from different companies that they actually are that actively working on, keeping their developers, still building stuff. Although actually 70% is thrown away, maybe. So that's a different mindset and that's actually changed maybe culture or behavior, which is pretty interesting.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:33:00] I can imagine that your approach can be to develop new functionality that those developers are building, and doing that more in smaller steps and keep validating if it is actually adding value to a user instead of. I'm building a school, new functionality are working on that for six months only to have it shut down by a, by an experiment, two weeks after.</p><p>that's obviously not, not nice for those, those developers, but if you can build in small steps and then. Early on. You can quickly already see, Hey, this is not working or we should go a different path. The chance of something not working, over a six month period is a much more, for such a large project.</p><p>I think, </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:33:41] yeah, I am. I have the bills, MTP, the smoke tests and step by step. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:33:46] Exactly. So how do you mentioned this earlier that you can now with turf start testing, you can actually experiment on a full release. Do you already have clients that have this implemented? So how would that process look like?</p><p>So there's a release ready? Maybe there's a twice a month or maybe even a weekly release off of their website with new functionality. do you do a full split test between the or the previous version and the new version? Or how would you approach it? Yeah, </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:34:12] so we have, one client I'm working with we're actually doing in service sites.</p><p>And the cool thing is that one of the people from zero time is also part of the development team. So she's like the owner and both teams. There's some desks are part of the sprint they actually doing and ever release every three weeks. And it just going live with release on, for example, Monday.</p><p>So then when, it's boost life, they actually push an AB that has life instead of the whole, or is that the go through to our numbers down to visit and goes to 50%. And actually the AB test is starting. And we already implement the end dates when it goes live. So it goes out automatically and we are force monitoring the results day by day.</p><p>So it's actually how it works out. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:34:55] How long do those experiments run </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:34:57] red diamond? The minimal detectable effect we have. So we actually galvanize France. So it's more planning because yeah, you can. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:35:05] So a minimum detectable effect, if it's just a release that's I don't know. it's not always based on all my proper hypothesis, whatever they are they're implementing.</p><p>They're just like fixers or I don't know, additional functionality that has to be done because legal or. Or whatever. So how would you determine that </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:35:22] indeed? you prefer I'm the MD, that's not always the case. I just finished a project with, with a big multinational company where we, desperate the whole website, but front end and backend, service sites, the backend was really outdated.</p><p>So logistics, wasn't as good documentation finance order follow up front and also needs some feature fixes. So they had a complete. New backend front ends on different server. I, we did a server side and that worked well. we analyze the data tweak and make sure that the conversion rates don't drop, when you have pushed the whole release new release, new website life.</p><p>yeah, that's definitely an example. Marcel recite is just perfect, to work with and, make sure you, have low risks when you do a </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:36:04] full release, but you, each week it can be something different. Of course, that changed that candidates, especially as service side, you can change a lot more things than you experiment on client side.</p><p>So I can imagine that's the only, like the main KPIs that you just basically check on live. They're not changing too much, but you cannot check every variable and that's out there. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:36:25] That's where we're at. And I think it's not the case that most companies we're working with the everything. So there's a release.</p><p>And maybe when it's something really small on a page with a lot of festers, then yeah. You can still test that. You can also think, okay, the impact will be really low. So just put it live. It's not like booking does go home that they test average after you back or everything, especially on breaks. She's right.</p><p>There's a lot of effects in the order flow. That's the, yeah. The thing we're focusing on. And then we actually Fest it server side, although it's a new subscription model or a new pricing stuff, or a total different redesign. From that page. These are battles because otherwise, in Africa, everything would go on to the best also on the FAQ page, blah, blah, blah, or whatever, like 10 people a day.</p><p>Yeah. Maybe you should just put it live and. Yeah. It's two years and then you will be there as well. But </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:37:16] yeah. Yeah. I'm just saying it's more like a check that things don't go horribly wrong when you release something. And that's when you want to </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:37:24] now, if you have a server side technology, you can do feature flagging feature rollouts as well.</p><p>so it doesn't have to be in big experiments, but if you can roll it out, 5%, 10%, 20%, and see if there are no bugs errors, it's nothing. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:37:38] Yeah. Especially if it's, if those are big changes, you want to maybe gradually release them by 33 audience. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:37:45] I think it's big in the rest of made as part of support of AB testing.</p><p>Is that what you're saying is not losing money instead of, you're only looking for winners, but in this case you can also, I want to talk to Lucas from Brooklyn about it. He also said that's the, actually the main founders for booking is that they. For sure. They're not losing money with everything.</p><p>What's that already big difference. And then of course you want to add some extra revenue also by finding a positive result. I think many companies that don't know what they actually do that area </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:38:15] yesterday's brainstorm was so good. I really liked step's idea of running that test on the call to action buttons, making them orange will really make them stand out.</p><p>Don't you? I think. Yeah. Do you want to design real AB test winners and achieve enormous conversion uplift, then stop, brainstorming and take a scientific approach. If you can read Dutch, follow the steps and online input the bestseller on the menu, even book Delta now and rule in the office course and become an expert in applying proven behavioral signs yourself, go to &nbsp;dot com for more information and free downloads.</p><p>Yeah. If you're, especially if you're AB testing capacity is limited, then you can only do so much experiments in a month. While on the other end, the developers are releasing a new stuff. Like every week there's an, there's a new release. It's we call it in Dutch development economy, mopping the floor while the is still running.</p><p>but, yeah, so you're. you're you can be very limited, but you want to make sure that those releases don't break any big things or make things worse for your customer. but there's no intention to do that, of course, but, you might to make sure that's not the case.</p><p>So I just, so one last, I think is something that's a benefit for service site, that things, since you have all the data in house, I think. Almost by definition. you have, since you have all the data from individual customers and, it's easier, a non binomial test, surface rights. you can easily more easily compare revenue gains for four experiments when you run them server side, first client side.</p><p>If you do client side, usually. you're working with aggregated data and Google analytics, and then it's not possible anymore to, to compare those </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:40:04] true. when I was working for a publishing a website, we need to have the Nominom, your KPI</p><p>and we have separate scripts within each test to send the client ID to Google analytics and do it that way. but yeah, so resides, those should be more easy </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:40:20] to get that data. Darryl has to do with, client side, but, it needs additional work. So I want to make a small side of that. like Don just mentioned, of course has speed is very important for your indexation.</p><p>so that might be a reason to run server sites. it does seem to, cause it's a bit faster, recently, Google announced that, they also want to include like UX factors in their ranking. Have you guys read anything about this? </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:40:43] I actually did it </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:40:45] so they want, they want to include those in the ranking, but I'm very much wondering how they, how on earth they will.</p><p>it needs to be automated. They're not they're notes. Having a user panels, evaluating every site in the world. So I think, so there must be some way to automatically, judge the UX of a website. I'm very curious how they will be doing that's </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:41:04] fine. And in some sense, it's already in there of course, because if you search for, if you have a search term, like wanting to buy a computer and you click on the first results and within a minute, you're back at Google and click on the second results, then Google already knows that the first result lessons that relevant for you.</p><p>And of course when you as well, Beth contributes to people finding the information they need and buying a computer they want. So in some sense, I guess it's already in there. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:41:29] There's definitely an overlap that, so for this, for the 40 effectiveness of the patient is definitely the case. If you're back in Google, then that's an indication, Hey, apparently that person didn't find what they were looking for.</p><p>So they're back. but, so since they announced this as a separate thing, that they will be looking at the user experience, I'm very much I'm intrigued about how they will be doing this. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:41:52] I think they just need to crawl every website on how many AB desk companies are exited rotating. So they know that's going to be actually checking once it's working better.</p><p>And then they shoot. Here for a higher score for death website, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:42:05] then I just go about and just run a million experiments on my websites, not caring about the results </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:42:12] I haven't gone really slow. So you still </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:42:13] end up doing it service side. So that's all fine. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:42:17] yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it feels this way. So let's you're I don't want to fix that.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:42:26] I th I think you can measure it. I just think it's going to be really hard just by and by running a script on a page. So any other things you guys are looking forward to do, to change or improve in the coming 12 months, whether it's serves site testing or any other general things that you're working on?</p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:42:41] Of course. Yeah. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:42:44] Yeah. Yeah. But I'm still working on also, as we were in evades Elma, I'm like getting more and more of the process and our Dave will actually, so in the latest thought he thought uric, we actually included them. And now this is off the test. We also not implementing the research. So to the phase before the experimentation, so that it becomes more and more, Yeah, kind of platform or all the information or the knowledge of optimization is there, but we all need to build a AB splits on top of it.</p><p>And then we have our own tool. Maybe there'll be cool with the next year </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:43:15] and the air. So the air table talk. I will link to that in the show notes. that's I think there's like a five minute talk. It's very, it's quite short, right? </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:43:22] Good way to set it up yet. It's five minutes dogs, $5 a day for five minutes.</p><p>Exactly. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:43:26] For five days, four minutes and 51 seconds. You're very good </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:43:32] because she already recorded herself. That diamond was next.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:43:41] talk faster and faster towards the end door. Basically in short, you, you show the solution where you use air table, where people can log their experiments, and then you're even using the API, to get Google analytic data in a fire. Google sheets. Yeah. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:43:58] Yeah, that's correct. So we put the coolest sheets.</p><p>So the good thing is that everything of the process are these I, and I want to say is all the information needed to actually get a test from through Z that is already in our table, but you also want to create a database with actually a results. And we all combined us and everything and will not. And the next step is to actually also with the research we do out from the ed.</p><p>So you're actually doing experiments on the Bates, for example, but you don't do that. You also have their friends in size from the own page and it would be cool to get one overview of the experiments, your surveys, the data, heat maps, whatever, everything together. In one place </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:44:41] and automation of the reports, of course.</p><p>very helpful. Very nice to save a lot of time on there. </p><p>Tom van den Berg: [00:44:45] Yeah. I think it's, it stays around, two to three hours per experiment. So yeah, that helps you </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:44:51] if I'm, if you run a couple of experiments a month, for sure. </p><p>Ruben de Boer: [00:44:55] Yeah. You have all the information in one place, which is a, it's a big benefit.</p><p>Exactly. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:44:59] For a nice. Guys, thank you so much for, for sharing your experience with, with, surface site testing and we'll link to the tools mentioned, we'll link to the, I had some other blogs on this topic. If you want to read more on this and as a blog, all my converse at comb CXL and, They all have written some stuff about this lately, so I'll make sure to check those out.</p><p>And of course I'll link to, to talk, from the whole jar that lightening talks about three tips to improve your experimentation program with Ansible. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks much guys. Talk to you soon. And this concludes season two, episode 36 of the sheer Oak fade podcast with Ruben, the board and dialogue next week in our English episodes, where we'll be discussing how you can and should be here using experimentation to manage risk and create a risk profile for your own or your client's business.</p><p>I will be doing that together with the CEO of conversional Steven, talk to you then, and always be optimizing.</p><p>‍</p>",,1542b3e8

Um, so I, I started my career in, uh, well, I guess what now would be called data science, but we didn't call it that then it was just called analytics. Um, so I worked in sort of direct marketing and CRM.</p><p>Um, And then we became a kind of a consultant, really helping people with things like segmentation and propensity modeling and spatial analytics and things like that. And then I was working for an agency that was doing that did a bit of both of that sort of offline stuff in digital. And this was in about 2007 or something like that.</p><p>And, um, and I saw, I sort of just got exposed to this sort of world of digital analytics and, um, you know, and, and. Conversion optimization. Wasn't really a thing. Then it like AB testing tools were just about emerging. Um, and I just became fascinated in that, but particularly I saw that the people, most of the people that were doing that sort of stuff, product, no actual experience in analytics.</p><p>So I thought it must be quite. Beneficial to take that real experience of analytics and put it with that. So that's why I kind of crossed over into digital. And, um, and that was, that was a successful thing. Kind of, um, uh, got me in know quite a lot. Yeah. The, most of the people doing it at the time, I then run analytics and conversion.</p><p>Agency teams in a couple of agencies for about seven or eight years. Um, most of that time was with a big global agency called RGA. Um, uh, had quite a lot of New York and they're kind of, um, an innovation consultancy really. So whilst running a team, I then ended up becoming more of a management consultant.</p><p>So I would fly around the world and help big organizations with their sort of internal setup for analytics and conversion. So people like nightie, um, this big Russian retailer called M video Manchester, United few of the companies like that. And, um, and then I had a baby, so I just couldn't do the travel anymore.</p><p>So I wanted to go client side. So I did a stint at visa working on, uh, their, um, version of PayPal is called visa checkout. Um, and then went to work for sky. And, uh, sky's sort of probably the most interesting part of my story, I guess. So sky before I worked that hard, um, had real soft, fragmented, different digital teams in different parts of the business and for efficiency reasons, they wanted to put it all together into a center of excellence in leads.</p><p>And I was hired right at the start of that process, um, with quite a broad remit, really just about how. How do you make that sort of thing, commercially beneficial and how do you make sure it has good commercial impact? And because of my background, my answer to that question is, you know, experimentation.</p><p>So I built a, uh, a big experimentation function there. Um, the really interesting part about it was because we were building this center of excellence. There was nothing legacy to deal with. We, you know, we were literally building everything from scratch, including older. Ways of working for developers in the agile methodologies and everything from scratch.</p><p>So it was a really interesting, great opportunity just to go, right. What's the perfect way that this should work and, and stay up right from the beginning. And that's what we did. And so that's still running a lot like that now, even though I'm not there, um, That's by incidentally, where I learned a hell of a lot about what we're going to talk about today, which is, you know, how do you, how do you properly integrate experimentation with our job?</p><p>Um, and I learned that the, uh, you know, the hard way in some ways, </p><p>Guido: [00:05:14] And Skype keeps popping up as positive examples, uh, of how to do a CRO. A lot of people, uh, from sky I see popping around and talking about it's, uh, uh, conferences. </p><p>Jonny: [00:05:27] Yeah. Um, I, um, I bought optimized whilst I was staff sky and, um, I never a big advocate of what we, what we built at sky and how that works.</p><p>And, and, you know, from a process, point of view, how it works without jail and stuff, particularly because a big cause most of our testing was server-side testing as well. So we had the developers really heavily involved in that using full stack and things. </p><p>Guido: [00:05:47] Yeah, no. Um, optimizing now, uh, being bought by, uh, by epi server or what, w what was your first reaction to that?</p><p>Jonny: [00:05:56] I mean, that's a bit because now, uh, I, you know, I run a consultancy and we work with small clients. We don't actually have any clients that have optimized because it's so expensive. Um, and so I'm a bit removed from, it really is a thing. So I don't know. I thought it was a bit odd. Um, there's, you know, it's not the most obvious connection that you would make, but, um, other than that, I don't know, you know, like, I don't know much about the acquisition and what it will mean or anything like that.</p><p>So certainly I've, I have heard some grumblings from people that they believe it will change things and stuff like that, but I don't know much about it. Really. </p><p>Guido: [00:06:34] Yeah. I've spoken to a couple of people that are almost no one saw this coming. That's basically the, the main trends and, um, Uh, yeah, we'll see what this brings.</p><p>If it will remove, uh, automatically from the, uh, basically the open market as a free service, or if it's going to be connected to episode over alone, we'll have to see. I mean, I actually have a scheduled, um, uh, both guys with, um, the CEO for my episode for Alex Augsburger. So, um, I'm going to ask him, so what, what, uh, uh, uh, just introduction, how you got started with, with CRO.</p><p>Why are you still in Ciro? </p><p>Jonny: [00:07:13] Yeah. Well, um, so I, uh, I just generally have this real passionate about the whole thing or I can always have, um, and part of that's fueled by the fact that I honestly think that not very many people do it right at all. Um, you know, th there's a, there's a whole range of. What you mean when you say CRO, like I'm really big spectrum and like, you know, you have at the bottom end of the scale companies who, um, you know, they've literally got somebody in the marketing team who very occasionally runs an AB test and Google optimize or something like that.</p><p>And they can genuinely believe that they do CRO, um, by doing that. And then at the opposite end of the scale, you know, you've got sky all the way up to booking.com and I'll do the big guys that people talk about when they talk about experimentation. And this there's a whole range in between that, but the vast, vast majority of people, um, I solved the bottom, ended up scale and, and don't realize it.</p><p>And that's just real sort of, it's really interesting for me. It's really, it's something that I want to try and change. I want to try and open people's eyes to the fact that there's a better way to do it and that it has such enormous benefit as well. Like, you know, when you do it right, and you get the right process behind it, it just, can't not have.</p><p>Really really massive impact and a really beneficial impact. And so that's actually really what drove me to, to start journey further conversion because, um, you know, I just, I just want to kind of go out there and open people's eyes to it and get them to understand that. But at the end of the day, then I like to have to really answer your question.</p><p>It's just an alert. I'm sure a lot of people in Sarah are the same. It's just, there's some thing. Really really exciting about, about running tests and about running experiments and proving things and particularly not putting things as well, because you know that one of the things I always tell people is, um, The only really true thing about CRO is that, you know, you can't really guess what's going to work.</p><p>You can't really, um, you know, you can't really sort of second guess things and have best practices because at the end of the day, things that seem really obvious, um, will fail and things that seem really stupid will win. And that is really fascinating and learn, trying to understand why those things are like that, and also exposing your own.</p><p>Um, you know, cognitive bias and things like that is just, it's just really interesting and exciting. So.</p><p>Guido: [00:10:13] When you encounter a client or prospect that comes to you for, for help. And they do just the, like you said, Uh, marketing department, very, uh, distributors. And they, a couple of times a year, they, they run, they beat us and they think, okay, we do see are already, but what do you tell them? What's your role really about?</p><p>Jonny: [00:10:31] Yeah, so the, the, the really interesting stat that I've, I've very often start with. Is, uh, from Australia optimized, we actually did this study. So you may know of it. They gave, um, virtually I think all of their historical data from the whole platform to Stephan Tomko, um, uh, Harvard business school and, um, and you know, he was running.</p><p>Yeah. He was running research on all sorts of different nuances of statistics and things like that. But the overarching thing that he came out with, which he mentioned in his book is that, uh, only one in 10 of all of those tests historically have ever been run on the platform, came out with a positive result.</p><p>And, um, you know, another way to look at that. So, you know, if you, if you're an e-commerce director or any kind of website owner or whatever, the other way to look at that is that. Everything that you do to your website in no matter how big or small you're kind of, you're making content changes your, you know, putting things through your dev agency.</p><p>And if you're not testing any of those things, then there's a really good chance that nine out of 10 of those things is a waste of money or a waste of time, or even worse is damaging your revenue. And that's what I try and get people to realize. First of all, it's like, and, you know, just by showing examples of strengths where, um, you know, where.</p><p>It seemed like a no brainer. It seemed like something that, you know, like you couldn't possibly not do the actually turned out to be detrimental, then they start to get it and they start to realize actually, yeah, you know, you, you know, everything you do to your outward facing website is a risk. And then.</p><p>You know, so CRO, which, you know, as we all know is not a great term for what we actually do. Um, but CRO is really kind of risk management. You know, that is what it is. You are, you are basically making sure that what you invest in web development and. Is commercially beneficial and commercially impactful and, and not a waste of money.</p><p>So, you know, there's, there's, there's a whole way of like, Oh, so articulate in the economics behind it, of how, you know, you, you know, what you're effectively doing is you're not you, you know, number one, you're not doing things that don't work, but as well as saving the. You know, damage to your conversion rate and revenue and profit and everything that goes along with that.</p><p>You're also not spending the money in production, web development to develop those things. So, you know, there's a, there's a whole sort of virtual circle of had. And even if you, even if you spend money on CRO in done properly, that should basically almost just displace what you would have spent in production, web development on things that you're not.</p><p>You know that aren't going to work. So it's not really a new cost. It's just a more efficient version of web development and a less risky version of what department in a way. And it's probably easier, </p><p>Guido: [00:13:23] uh, to follow the things true through syrup because you don't necessarily have to develop the whole product or functionality.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Jonny: [00:13:32] Yeah. Nice. And often, often an objection be, well, you know, there's some, there's just some big things that we know we need to do. And, you know, we can't really test them cause they're too big. Like we need to, um, implement PayPal or we need to, uh, you know, redesign the checkout or whatever. And you know, from there you can sort of say, well, why do you need to do that?</p><p>What makes you think you need to do that? You know, how do you know, like, uh, and often like, you know, redesigning a checkout? Well, I, well, you know, we haven't done it for a long time and, uh, you know, nobody likes it and it's like, well, who doesn't like it? You know, you don't like it. Well, you know, maybe your customers might.</p><p>Um, so, you know, you've got to go back to, um, You know, really like, you know, you start with research, you then start testing small things. And again, like, you know, a lot of people would test small things and then just implement them or not, and move on. But the whole point should be that you are, you're building up this sort of ladder of learning.</p><p>Like, you know, you test small things. If a small thing works, then that should give you. An indication that that gives you the license to do a slightly bigger thing along the same theme, because you've proven that there's a point in investing a little bit more time and effort in doing that. And eventually you might get to a fairly big project which you're doing in production, web development, and then you would feature.</p><p>Test it before actually releasing it just to make sure or to refine it. But by the time you've got to do that, you should have, you should have proven that there's a point in doing that piece of work in the first place. And that to me is, is what experimentation is, is, you know, co conversely to CRO, which a lot of people.</p><p>Use those, like, you know, let's test these, let's hack these few things on the front end, just to try and track a bit more revenue out of the website, you know, really excellent experimentation done properly as a sort of a Canon of going from research to learning to the development of that learning to ultimately doing bigger things and bolder things by the bits of innovation, which ultimately costs money.</p><p>But that's the point is you have, you have de-risk that money that you're smiling. </p><p>Guido: [00:15:34] Yeah, framing it as Richmond management, uh, makes a lot of sense. I think, uh, we did an episode about specifically that with, uh, Stephen Buffalo, which, uh, I'll link to that in the, in the, in the show notes. And I wouldn't be the first time I, I got to a client and they actually.</p><p>Because the term experimentation for some people have as the connotation of actually being something that's very risky. Well, actually it's, it's the opposite. Uh, at least the way, the way that we, uh, do it with, uh, with, uh, CRO and yeah, I think, I think actually the, the one in 10 that you mentioned, uh, from, um, the, the Stephen Tompkins research, I think that that might be actually.</p><p>They might be positive buyers in there still because those are experiments that people will consciously</p><p>one in 10 might be even on the positive side for that all the changes have. </p><p>Jonny: [00:16:26] Cause you got to think as well, like all those companies they'd bought optimized. Like so not only are they doing testing, they must be reasonably serious about it because they've got miserly, you know? So, yeah. And, and that means that they're probably putting a reasonable amount of research.</p><p>And data behind those tests. So absolutely that, that could be, that could be positive or too positive even. Um, but they're, they're, they're, they're the thing, like, I dunno, um, ultimately your, ultimately we're trying to persuade somebody like an e-commerce director or somebody relatively senior, um, you know, tick to consider the essence, consider, you know, the, the transformation that goes with doing it properly.</p><p>And, um, and I find the challenge is often that. That those kinds of people they have at some point sort of box heck CRO by the fact that they've got, you know, somebody over there that does that, um, or an agency that's doing a bit of that for the Muslim thing like that. And it's almost a kind of a unit, you know, um, You might have like a balance sheet where they've got, they've got annual budgets and they've got PPC, SEO CRO.</p><p>And by that fact they think that they are doing CRO. And just back to what I was saying originally, there's so many different. Things that CRO can mean, but you know, they're part of the challenge is that, you know, th they will say, well, we've got a CRO person. We've got even got like little CRO team, so we've got it covered.</p><p>That's absolutely fine. We're doing it. And yet, what, what are you trying to get them to realize is that, um, It's a tactic that should sit alongside PPC and SEO. It's a, it's a whole way of life around how you do web development or even marketing as well in a way. But, but that's the difference where you're trying to get people to say, and I'll say like, you know, so you've got your CRO.</p><p>What. What's in your roadmap for web development and where did that stuff come from? Because that's the thing, you know, they'll find that, well, I've got this roadmap, web development, and there's a whole load of stuff in there. We did a strategy presentation at the beginning of the year and we've got redesigned the checkout and we've got, you know, new payment methods and we've got, um, you know, tech debt and all this kind of stuff in the, in the, in the roadmap.</p><p>Um, and then there's also a few little things that came out of the CRO team and you're like, well, If what you mean by CRO, if really, if you take away the term, what it really is, is simply using research and data to understand what you should do to your website and experimenting, to validate. Whether you really should or not.</p><p>That's all it is. So why would you do anything other than that? Why have you got some stuff here in this roadmap that isn't that, and then a little bit of stuff that is that, you know, that's, that's where you're trying to get people to understand. It's really, you go to somebody at that level, you have to go back to the economics of it and say, you know, you are you effectively, um, doing this stuff, investing in web development, either with an internal team or an agency, and you have no real idea whether that stuff is going to work.</p><p>So, you know, you've, you've putting a massive risk on that investment by guessing. And even though they might not feel like it's guessing because you know, we've had the, did all this work that, so do we need a new checkout? Well, you know, </p><p>Guido: [00:19:39] the competitors doing it, so it's, I'm guessing. </p><p>Jonny: [00:19:41] Yeah. Yeah. It's like, I'll check out, just look like John Lewis has checkout, so we need it to, you know, </p><p>Guido: [00:19:47] exactly.</p><p>Well, so you just mentioned already, uh, that there's, uh, you can apply this to product and, uh, but also marketing. Um, how would you see it? Because today we're talking about how to embed the, a, this experimentation, a way of working, uh, into agile product development. Um, How do you see this experimentation applied to marketing versus product?</p><p>Jonny: [00:20:09] Yeah, I think like, um, I think that all comes down to the process that you have and, uh, you know, what a lot of people, what we talk about and what I love, I know a lot of other people talk about as a sort of operating system, um, for experimentation, which is really, you know, the system it's validation of how you go from.</p><p>Research and data that understands customer problems and opportunities and things like that to ideas, to experimentation. And in that sense of experimentation is really, uh, a word for validation. And so if you take it to a slightly higher level where you're simply, you know, managing the process of research, data and insights, Then monitoring the process of ideation and prioritization of ideas and what you should be doing, and then doing some kind of validation in order to ensure that those ideas are really the right ideas before you actually pushed them out into the real world, then that doesn't have to necessarily.</p><p>Um, relate just to website content that can be, you know, marketing, it could be, um, you know, PPC messaging testing, or all sorts of things. Um, and I mean, you know, in a lot of those channels, you can do experimentation in the same way. So I don't really see that, you know, you need to necessarily, um, limit it just to website content.</p><p>Although of course that's where it is. Traditionally most teams, um, out of interest, like after I worked at sky, I then went. To be the e-commerce director of a hotel company, fairly large hotel company in the UK. Um, and what attracted me to that was, was that really like an experiment, like, you know, it's an experimental job.</p><p>Like what happens if I take this stuff and this way of working that I've built as sky and apply it to everything because I run the P and L for not just the website, but all of the marketing and distribution as well. And, um, and so I, I use the same process and use the same. Uh, uh, system that I developed for everything and it works really, really well.</p><p>Um, and that's now what we, what we effectively sell and help other people with, uh, at journey further. Um, but yeah, like it doesn't. I think if you, if you get hung up on the idea of an AB test and all the statistical significance and things like that, which absolutely you should do where you can, then it precludes you from doing other kinds of validation where that's, that's really what it is you're doing.</p><p>You're validating ideas. Um, so yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:22:41] I think it makes sense. That's a, you start doing this, uh, on your own marketing channels. I mean, that's, that's where you probably have the most traffic and in terms of Shiro, if that includes AB testing, that's where you have a lot of data. Um, but of course it's that those principles you can apply them to.</p><p>Email SEO, SCA, uh, products, uh, all your marketing channels. It's not exclusive for digital, um, for your own website. </p><p>Jonny: [00:23:07] Yeah. And, and also if you have a really good, well articulated, um, sort of strategy for what. Performance means like how you, how you basically kind of chunk out performance into the different leavers that you can pull in order to drive profitability for your business.</p><p>Then, you know, that will naturally cascade down into the different things that you're doing to the different traffic drivers, different, you know, parts of conversion and things like that. Even if you're an e-commerce business into things like, um, the distribution chain or, you know, the, the, you know, uh, Returns and stuff like that.</p><p>So, you know, if you, if you can articulate things really well like that, then you've got a really good holistic view of what the business looks like in terms of what you can do to affect it, then optimization in the pure sense of the word means you're going to try and optimize all those different things.</p><p>Um, and then, you know, again, going back to the idea that optimization or experimentation is just. Um, using research and data to understand where the opportunities are. Um, some sort of validation to make sure that, you know, you're taking your own cognitive bias out of the equation, then you can, you should do that for </p><p>Guido: [00:24:20] everything.</p><p>Yeah. And the validation doesn't need to be an AB test. Right? That's uh, often, uh, something that's, uh, uh, people use as a contract. Oh, we cannot do zero because we don't have to traffic. Uh, like we're a business to business. We can not do. Uh, we don't have the traffic to do AB testing and thus, we cannot do zero.</p><p>Jonny: [00:24:38] Yeah. And of course that's not true at us. Never tree, rarely you come, you absolutely come and do a B testing. You just have to understand the statistics of it. You know, you have to understand. The statistics well enough to know that there is a, there is a place where you can accept much lower levels of significance than 95%.</p><p>Um, as long as you, you know, using sample sizes in the right way and things like that, and, you know, testing on upstream metrics rather than eventual conversion and all that sort of stuff, you absolutely can do it. But even if like, you know, it gets to the level where, you know, It's really, really imperfect.</p><p>It's still better than not doing it. You know, it's still always slightly better than not bothering and just guessing, you know, you knew, and again, the whole point is that you start learning and you, you might run these tests that maybe they're not perfect statistically, but you will learn. From the data that you get off the back of it and the postdocs research and all that sort of stuff.</p><p>So, uh, </p><p>Guido: [00:25:32] assuming your, your company grows in your marketing channels grow, you will prepare, be very good preparation for when the time comes. Uh, and, and you can run those tests. Or make a test or more test anyway. Uh, so we're here to talk about, uh, specifically your, your, uh, article about, uh, admitting experimentation.</p><p>Um, so first off let's ask the question. I mean, this is, uh, probably so embedding it in an organization, uh, or amending it into your, uh, agile product development is probably in contrast to. Having it as a standalone team. Um, so one of the differences there, what, why should you go for a bending it in your whole process?</p><p>Well, </p><p>Jonny: [00:26:14] just before we go onto that, there's a couple of things, really. So, uh, what, what sometimes what, I mean, when I talk about embedding it is, um, as simpler levels and thinking about our jail and, and sort of organizational structures and things like that. It's simply having a really properly defined process for how you, um, get something from experimentation into production development and where that comes from is what, you know, we, we come across this a lot with clients that we have where, um, you know, somebody, um, And there may be sort of a CRO internal person or an agency or something like that.</p><p>And, um, they're running tests and some of those will win. And then, you know, they're effectively saying, this is what, and you should push this live. And what you find a lot of the time is that that stuff can just sort of linger, um, and not actually ever really get. You know, produced. Um, and that's why you got this thing where you have people who just have tons and tons of tests running at a hundred percent in their, in the AB testing platforms, because they can't really get those tests pushed lines.</p><p>And you've got to think like, why is that? Like, why, why, why can you not do that? And it's because of, uh, you know, some sort of disconnect between the way that soft production web development. Uh, operation and ultimately Pew and prioritization is run and what those tests are. And, you know, for example, there are things like, um, you know, uh, a lot of the time, um, the, the output of an AB test is quite a simple change and.</p><p>Um, developers a lot of the time don't really like to work on small things. You know, you can have a, an internal dev team and those developers may just naturally sort of gravitate towards like bigger, more interesting projects that are in, you know, particularly that involve them working in new and different code bases, like react and things like that.</p><p>Or </p><p>Guido: [00:28:17] give me a new framework and all that. </p><p>Jonny: [00:28:19] Yeah, exactly. So there's, there's things like that. That can mean that, you know, here's a simple test that. You know, it was just a content change to a page. I need to push in life how that can just kind of linger. Um, similarly, you know, there are, there are things like the, the sort of hippo effect where, um, you might have senior people just sort of saying, you know, I need, I need this doing now.</p><p>And these are kind of bigger things and those things will turn round the top of that dev queue. And so the CRO team, and not really getting any traction because they're not. Seen as having the authority to actually dictate what should go through the production web development queue. And there's a ton of other things like that, where, um, you know, it's very easy to overlook those things.</p><p>And just to then end up sort of, you know, for a CRO team or a Sarah person just be, you know, kind of. Uh, as I say, leaving everything at a hundred percent because you can't really do anything else. Um, so that's, that's sort of like the, the simple thing is that, you know, you, people just need to think about that, to think about what is the process, um, </p><p>Guido: [00:29:22] uh, with a, with a company, uh, very recognizable that all these changes that we, uh, Uh, suggested that it came from a researcher and a AB test, all added to the bottom of the, of the, of the queue for, uh, for development.</p><p>Never really got to the top. And after a couple of months of implementing nothing, uh, suddenly conversion went down because they, they changed the whole pricing model of the website. Of their service, which obviously has nothing to do with, with the usability of the website or whatever, but they look for that.</p><p>So, Hey guys, zero's the conversion is going down. What, what should we do? Well, we have this whole list of, uh, currently 50 items. That you haven't implemented yet or improvements or the website let's do that. So they picked up all these items in one, uh, two sprints, two weeks sprints, and I think conversion John gen.</p><p>So there were a price comparison websites. Uh, I think the, uh, the conversion was before that was like 32 ish percent click outs. And also implementing those 50 changes. They were up to 43. This is a massive difference also and all small changes. </p><p>Jonny: [00:30:33] Yeah, I know a lot sometimes. Isn't that. So, um, yeah, but with agile, particularly, um, as well, you know, just on a, sort of a bigger level than what I was just talking about.</p><p>The thing with agile is that, you know, you, you know, in, in, in a company like sky, you know, you've got, um, uh, you know, very, very big. Team of developers split into different sort of squads and tribes and all this kind of stuff. And, um, really the, the, one of the original concepts of agile based on the manifesto is that it's about, um, Those sort of little groups of people working as a sort of an autonomous unit and being responsible for that product or area of the website or whatever, and having a level of autonomous control over it.</p><p>And, and you know, if it's gonna work the way it's really supposed to work. Yeah. That, that autonomous unit should be feeding directly from customer insight and customer data and adapting the product, um, accordingly. And that's how it's meant to work. Right. I mean, it doesn't always work like that. Like, you know, when people say they've got agile, it really often isn't like that.</p><p>It's, you know, it's, it's a way for seemingly people more senior to get things done faster than they would have otherwise done. Um, However, that is how it's supposed to work. So, um, you know, uh, that it's health should inherently be experimental because if the idea is you've got this, you know, this, uh, product team, um, like, you know, Product squad in an agile environment.</p><p>And you know, that part of the manifesto that says it's written customer collaboration means that you should be listening to customers and constantly feeding from customer data to understand what the improvements are that should be make well. That is. Research and analytics that is customer research and analytics.</p><p>And then, you know, the, the other parts of our jar, which are about MVP and all that sort of stuff is ultimately about de-risking what's happening through gradually developing features in a way that they can be, uh, extensively tested and developed, um, you know, in an expletive manner and that's experimentation.</p><p>So really like, you know, If you really purely look at the agile manifesto, then agile and experimentation are the same thing effectively. They are. That is what it's supposed to be about. So for that reason, you know, you almost, you know, you almost shouldn't, you know, if you just look at it on a very, very pure way, You shouldn't really need to embed experimentation into it because it already, it already is, or it should be that.</p><p>Guido: [00:33:20] So mainly a branding problem that we have. </p><p>Jonny: [00:33:24] I think it's, uh, yeah, the, the a hundred percent is a branding problem, but I think it's more, it's more, um, that. You know, our jail isn't and hardly ever is implemented in the way that it was probably originally intended. Um, you know, it's, it's very often just simply seen as a way of working for developers.</p><p>Uh, and, um, you know, if you think that like pure way it's meant to work, because you've got this autonomous team that are constantly like, you know, Feeding off customer data and developing things. Well, that's not really how it works. Like, you know, you've got a little squad of developers and they get given stuff.</p><p>Bye. Um, smell. So were a product owner. Um, and, um, and that stuff gets prioritized according to who shouts the loudest and things like that in the organization. And, um, none of it would ever really get tested because, you know, somebody said do it. So, yeah. Uh, the </p><p>Guido: [00:34:27] weather we, yeah, </p><p>Jonny: [00:34:29] exactly. So, um, um, and in that respect and know the, the agile team will be kind of, we'll be disassociated from the responsibility of whatever it is that they're producing.</p><p>So, you know, like, um, the, the, it's an agile team in an engineering department that is, um, delivering stuff that they're told to by the marketing team or by, yeah. The, um, you know, the sales team or whatever. And so they're almost like a, kind of a little internal agency that is just funded by somebody else to do stuff, </p><p>Guido: [00:35:07] very de motivating.</p><p>Right. For those people </p><p>Jonny: [00:35:09] slightly. Yeah. Especially, especially when they, I think are acutely aware of what of the way our gel is meant to work. Um, and so, yeah, you've got this, you know, you've got this sort of, um, Worldwide. So it's a little bit like, you know, an, uh, youth, uh, company using an external dev agency where that dove agency will not typically challenge what it is that they're asked to do.</p><p>They'll just do it. And then, you know, and, and also why would you that, and as that, as the engineering team, Want to test those things because you're not responsible for the commercial output of them. And, uh, you know, so that, that's where it all kind of goes stray, really. Um, you know, when then. Just back to your very original question.</p><p>Like when the one actually talk about, um, van bedding, experimentation to watch all that comes from that place where, you know, most people probably got a CRO team over here and then, uh, you know, agile developers or an external agency even. Um, just back to what I was saying before, you know, here's this big list of stuff that they're working on and then his CRO over here and really like what, what it should be about is.</p><p>There's like a stage of stripping away the concept of CRO temporarily and saying, right, you know, what is going on here is you've got research and analysis and data that should be telling us the kinds of stuff that we should be doing and on a process of testing and learning that, um, that basically de-risks what we're actually doing.</p><p>And so when I, when I talk about embedding it in that level, it's just bringing those things together. You've got. If you've got a CRO team over there and you've got engineers over there, you've got what you need. You just haven't put them together in the right way. So you've got the expertise at data analytics and user testing and research and things like that.</p><p>You've then got the expertise of how to form that into. Ideas and prioritize ideas and all that sort of stuff. And you've got the developers to help execute it. You just haven't brought them together in the right way. Um, </p><p>Guido: [00:37:10] so did you encounter a, at a, at a prospect or a new client? Uh, where do you start? </p><p>Jonny: [00:37:17] Um, I think it's just.</p><p>With them generally tend to kind of start with what I was saying at the beginning around like the economics of it. Like, you know, you try and get people to understand the economics of it and the fact that they are doing things to the website, you know, that even though they seem like no-brainers could be having a detrimental effect.</p><p>Um, and then the other thing that the other thing I really try and get to create. Yeah, across the people is that it's not actually that difficult. Like I think, you know, um, you have conversations around this stuff with people, you know, uh, senior people in businesses and you know, that their minds of saying to them, Oh, transformation project.</p><p>And, you know, it sounds really complicated and business transformation and, you know, we're going to have to get Mackenzie and or something. And, um, and it isn't, it isn't really that hard. It's just about, you know, at the end of the day, And you really, really strip it down to what is, is better. Prioritizing the queue of stuff going into web development.</p><p>That's literally it like, you know, you've got a queue of stuff. You've got JIRA with a big list of stuff and that the team are going to, that the engineers are going to work through what is the best way to a put stuff into that list and be organized that list so that they are working on it. In the right way and giving that commercially output, the best commercial output.</p><p>And that is ultimately all it is, right. That is what it is. That's the absolute output of experimentation. Um, and so getting them to see that it all becomes a little bit more simple. Um, and then, you know, the idea of just reorganizing people and things like that gets a bit easier, but you know, then you've got kind of questions of like, um, what's the right model for it.</p><p>Um, you know, do you, um, try and sub democratize it and get product teams actually running experiments? Or do you have a, a small group that is, you know, running experimentation for them know that that's where I come back to this idea of properly embedding experimentation, which is in, in a way what, what we, um, what we managed to do at sky to an extent, which is that, you know, you.</p><p>Really going back to the idea of what our jail is. You should have a, uh, conversion optimization or experimentation. Kind of consultant or whatever you want to call them. That is aligned to each different product area. And their responsibility is ultimately, um, feeding research analysis and ideas into the product team.</p><p>And to an extent alongside the product owner, managing the process of, of that, of experimentation and what gets built and how it gets experimented on. And the. And how you go from sort of, you know, small tests to big tests and stuff like that. And that is their role within that, within that team. And if those, if all of those, if all those different, um, consultants are either are actually literally, you know, together a team under some sort of general line management, or they are just a virtual team.</p><p>Um, you know, depending on what their reporting structures are, then they can all work together to ensure the development of that function of that, that concept in the business. Um, now I think that's really important because again, going back to the idea of our child being sort of autonomous units, I don't think generally, um, people working in a proper agile way, like, um, Outside, uh, input if they can help it, because that is the con that is, you know, really what our job is supposed to be.</p><p>It's supposed to be, they're responsible for that. And if you, if you're able to put that within the squad and to make it a part of the squad and to involve everybody in it, so that, you know, literally daily stand ups, they're discussing the experimentation process and discussing what gets tested on and all this kind of stuff, then, um, that.</p><p>That to me works much and gets much, much better output. And, you know, I think not doing that, you would find a fair amount of resistance. Um, if, you know, if it's just a, somebody over in that BI team, like over there, who does experimentation is kind of telling us what we should test on and stuff like that, then, you know, you get a lot more resistance.</p><p>So, uh, </p><p>Guido: [00:41:42] I, I usually, uh, see in a zero specialist also, or does hero team as, as, as the body, that's advisers to the product manager on what to do, but it's still the product manager's choice if they're going to implement it or not, because it's not, she wrote him. We cannot necessarily. See the whole impact of implementing Samba something and all the business impacts of that.</p><p>I mean the development or the logistics on, on creating something we can say, okay, this is, this is the impact it will have on your users, but then it's still going to be, um, uh, up to the product owner to decide, okay, are we actually, does it make business sense to do it? </p><p>Jonny: [00:42:15] Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Um, I think the other, the other interesting part is like, you know, you got on the, on.</p><p>On one end of the scale, if you have a, if you have a CRO team, um, that have too much. Um, responsibility for actually executing every single part of the process. Then they become a real bot on that cause. So if, if every sort of product manager or product owner has to sort of go and say, right, we want to test this now.</p><p>And can you develop this test? And you know, and it's, it's going through a bond that then it becomes a bottleneck, but it. You know, the, the absolute opposite of that issue. Just give testing capabilities to every different product team, uh, and allow everybody to test everything. Then that's completely anarchic.</p><p>And, you know, you have, if you've got people running SAS throughout really that scaled and things like how to measure them and all that sort of stuff. So the sweet spot is somewhere in the middle, which is, um, you know, you might have. A little center of excellence or somebody at least who is responsible for really, you know, developing things like ways of measuring and processes that can be shared around our teams.</p><p>Um, and then you've got like a say that sort of federated. View where, where you've got individual people who are aligned to those squads who are, you know, helping that process and, and, and helping each squad run their tests. Then you've kind of got the best of both worlds. I mean, that's, you know, highly dependent on the organization itself and the way it's structured and what's right for it.</p><p>But I think that's, that's ultimately the goal with that sort of embedded view is that you've got that balance between having experts, having. Having real experts who are, you know, like maybe, you know, just simply championing the whole thing to expertise in each squad, that's actually helping deliver it.</p><p>And then ultimately you are really empowering the agile squads man engineers to really ultimately deliver against them.</p><p>Guido: [00:44:58] Besides the, the mindset that people haven't and of course, they're, they're, uh, they're used to a way of working that might not be completely agile. Um, What do you see are the biggest bottlenecks to, to achieving this? Um, for companies? </p><p>Jonny: [00:45:13] I think, well, like I say, I think just, um, a fear of, uh, of the complexity of change.</p><p>Um, so, you know, and, and, you know, and again, like in big organizations kind of changing things and restructuring things can seem really, really complicated. Um, But, you know, if you really break it down, it doesn't have to be that difficult. Really. Um, I think the other one is just, it's an unknown, unknown, uh, and, and just like I was saying earlier on, like, I, you know, I, I, I kind of have this mission to try and sort of open people's eyes to the fact that this can be like, um, way, way better of way of working that can drive like a massive amount of innovation.</p><p>But I think, you know, there's a lot of cases where like, just like I say, people don't know. That that's even a potential, like, you know, they, they wouldn't, it just wouldn't cross their mind. It's not like it's not like this sort of thing. Oh, you know, wish we were like booking.com and all that kind of stuff.</p><p>They're just not even not really aware of it as whole as a thing. So I think, you know, you've, you've, you've, you've got to kind of show people that it is a possibility before they can even start to think about, um, how the change might happen. Um, and then, you know, the other thing, the other big thing is just sort of, uh, different bits of cultural resistance to it.</p><p>And just like I say, that that can ultimately boil down to different sort of political ways of working within the organization, different things about responsibilities and stuff like that, where, you know, uh, who feels like they own, what, and you know, how do you then, um, you know, Introduced something new to that.</p><p>And, you know, you've, you've got to think about all that, but, um, yeah, it, it, it gets harder as the organization gets bigger, but, you know, I think really the way I do, I often advise people to start out with this is just to just start testing things and particularly to start trying test. Really sort of, uh, contentious things.</p><p>So, you know, if you, if you can find two senior people arguing about the design of a page or something like that and test it, then it, you know, it's like, um, </p><p>Guido: [00:47:27] you already know they care about it. </p><p>Jonny: [00:47:29] Yeah. Well, and also, uh, you know, one of them will be annoyed by the result, but. Um, you know, it's, it, it just massively raises the profile of experimentation.</p><p>You know, like the more, the more you can get people involved in things. And, and even if, you know, even if the one that it doesn't win, you can then show, well, here, look has all this. States that we got off the back of it. And, you know, you know, there is some likes in your idea if you do it this slightly different way, you know?</p><p>And so you kind of show the process of how, um, of how that sort of learning aspects of it works. And you know, that I think is how you just start to chip away and get people interested </p><p>Guido: [00:48:11] in. You need to, uh, you need to stay away from making it a personal thing. It shouldn't be a personal take on some, or you got it wrong.</p><p>Uh, you have the wrong ideas about this that you should probably stay away from that. </p><p>Jonny: [00:48:23] Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. You can, you know, you, um, I mean that, that, that is well, that's, that's the other interesting thing about it. Like you. That, that, that can only be a problem if people have that sort of cultural fear of failure, you know, like, you know, which often is the case.</p><p>Guido: [00:48:42] If you say to a, I don't know, a marketeer or that their campaign was unsuccessful or the, to the designer that they're designed didn't work that often feels like a personal attack and people might choke on that. </p><p>Jonny: [00:48:55] Yeah, absolutely. And like, you know, I think a lot of, in a lot of businesses, the whole. The whole sort of hierarchical nature of business itself, flight, um, you know, really sort of leads people to think, well, I've been hired into this really senior position I've been hired because of my expertise.</p><p>And I've got to demonstrate my expertise and my, and my ability to come up with ideas. And if those ideas are sort of proven to not work through a test, then yeah, that doesn't look good. But again, like that's why, um, As with any kind of experimentation, the most, most important thing is that it's the post research that you do afterwards, because what are you can learn, you know, like from even something that loses can have such a massive dramatic impact on something going forward.</p><p>So that's the most important things to try and get across is that the, you know, it's not. A test that doesn't win. It's not a failure. It's a very, very important piece of data and the will lead to something successful. So therefore in a way that idea. Was a good idea. It always is a good idea because you're going to learn something from it.</p><p>So </p><p>Guido: [00:50:05] you, uh, you just mentioned, uh, resources, I'm assuming, uh, like, uh, an average mid-sized company, um, What kind of resources do they need? What would the team look like if you have a free hand in, in, um, um, combining a team, uh, what skill set needs to need to be there, to have this in a, in a proper agile way, in, in a way that they can really make.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Jonny: [00:50:34] Yeah. I usually self present in sort of three chunks really well, maybe four, but like, I, you know, I kind of think of it as three broad areas, which is, um, research and analytics. Design and creative and, um, development basically. And, um, there are, you know, you can map out a whole set of different skill sets in each of those three broad categories that you need for.</p><p>Uh, a, any CRO function to develop, but that doesn't necessarily say where those skills should sit. And, and I, in a really small company there could, you know, you could try, you could do, you could try your best to find one person who can do all of them. Um, yeah, but in a bigger company, there might be skills that are distributed across different teams that all need to come together in different ways.</p><p>So, you know, in, in, in, in research and in analytics, you've got digital analytics, you've got, um, uh, you know, you might need like sort of more. Traditional offline data analytics for CRM data and stuff like that. Uh, those user psychology, um, user research, you know, you can go through all these different sorts of things.</p><p>Um, Design and creative, obviously like the most important thing really is, is, is essentially like, um, copywriting probably. Um, you know, you can get quite far without really using what you might call UX design or visual design, but eventually you are going to need those skills. Um, you've then got things like loss of broad design thinking and then, you know, in development.</p><p>Well, you know, again, you can get reasonably far without anything. Well, you know, if you're using a Wiziwig and you've got basic stuff, but then sort of very quickly, you're going to need front end developer. Um, eventually you might need backend development of some description. Um, and then alongside that, there's always the whole kind of thing of targeting and then two will implementation and stuff like that.</p><p>So there's a whole range of skills like that. And, um, You, you know, any organization thinking seriously about CRO just needs to think where, what is our plan for where we get all this stuff, um, in the short, medium and long-term, and, you know, for a large organization, all those things probably exist somewhere.</p><p>It's just, it's the process and the ability and the license for those things to be utilized where they're needed. So, you know, you, you may well have, um, Skilled digital analysts that sit within some sort of central BI team associated with Adobe analytics or something like that. Um, and they may not well be, you know, really structurally part of anything to do with, um, their website development a bit weird, but they might not be, but so, you know, What if this CRO functional team, whatever it looks like needs to use kind of advanced digital analytics, then how was I getting that unlike?</p><p>How is that sort of been almost cross charged and paid for or whatever, or, you know, it does, is that structure, right? So that's, you know, you kind of have to map out like, this is the, this is the resources needed and where it comes from. Um, And yeah, again, uh, with that sort of embedded RGR model, like, you know, our jail teams are always going to lean on the resources from other areas.</p><p>Uh, you know, you might have a specific user experience design and visual design team. So, you know, how does that work? Like what's the internal commercials almost like how to power do they get time and how do they secure time from them? You know, you have to think of it almost like almost like designing a little business within the business, hang on.</p><p>You know, these are the resources we need and, you know, um, there's, you know, while I was vice people, is things like, you know, you, you, you can get, you can get quite far just using Fiverr and things like that, you know, free lunches and stuff. Um, so, you know, Again, thinking about that map. You've got a thanks to, well, where can we just start to get bits of this results from externally until such point when we know we need to hire it internally</p><p>Guido: [00:55:00] and you, you can just hire those skills, right? I mean, it's important to have some knowledge buildup inside of your company, but execution. Uh, you can just, uh, especially in the beginning, you can just outsource. </p><p>Jonny: [00:55:10] Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:55:11] Yeah, &nbsp;thanks so much, uh, our hour together as a flown past. </p><p>Jonny: [00:55:17] Yeah, </p><p>Guido: [00:55:19] I think there's a lot of interesting information.</p><p>I think it can help a lot of, uh, people, uh, if they come to a company where agile is already implemented, that they can just reframe this as, uh, maybe it's not a scary new thing that we're trying to do or. It's just trying to do agile properly. I think that that might help a lot of people, uh, in, uh, in achieving their goals in an embedding zero and experimentation in agile.</p><p>Yep. Um, so you've been, uh, been in this, uh, working in this field for quite some time now. So where my final question for you will be, um, what's the inside that you think you might have that others in the industry don't have. </p><p>Jonny: [00:55:59] Um, so I think, you know, that you see that, uh, a hell of a lot of people working in CRO as we call it, um, have not ever really hard, the client's side.</p><p>Experience. Um, and you know, I think, I think traditionally CRO is a kind of a black box thing where, you know, like as a consultant or an agency, you would go to a competency, we'll go away and do this testing for you and come and tells you what, tell you what works. And I think we're on a tipping point where that is just.</p><p>You know, not going to be what people see CRO hours in the future. I think, um, you know, it ultimately is something that should be in-house and should be controlled within, within the business, because what it is is really a way of working around web development and digital innovation. And so. You know, but, but making that work in a business and the things that, the things that you need to change in order to do that is a very specific thing.</p><p>And, and, um, having done that, having built that client side, um, and, you know, with all of the consulting work that I used to do as well, um, I think that's really the sort of thing that I can bring to the table is w how do you. Adapt to structure internally in an organization in order to make it work. Um, and plus that just gives you, you know, that that just gives you a hell of a lot of insight about how to do the day job at guests as well, and in different ways and how to, how to kind of ultimately make it work.</p><p>So. Um, that's really what, what a big part of what we sort of say is our USP as an agency and, and every single person that works for me is X client site in exactly the same way as well. Um, and that's part of how we kind of go out and sell what we do. So, </p><p>Guido: [00:57:52] yeah. Nice. And my final question for you, um, who should I invite on this podcast?</p><p>Who inspires you all will be guests to share their experience here. </p><p>Jonny: [00:58:02] John Crowder. He works for me, um, is, uh, absolutely brilliant and this sort of fell, but he's also, um, just a really great personality. So yeah, it will be, uh, it would be a really interesting person to have on. Um, </p><p>Guido: [00:58:16] and what should we talk about, </p><p>Jonny: [00:58:18] uh, I think you'd have to ask him, but I think so he's, he is on, on the side a, um, uh, in a, in a couple of rock bands and stuff like that.</p><p>So, um, he, you know, just has a lot of, um, </p><p>Guido: [00:58:35] so he's a proper funeral rockstar. </p><p>Jonny: [00:58:39] I can't imagine he would ever want to call himself that, but</p><p>yeah, something around that, um, </p><p>Guido: [00:58:49] Cool. So if you can introduce us, then we'll connect and see if we can work something out for both guests. Thank you so much. Thank you for your time. And, um, talk to you again soon.</p><p>‍</p>",,

Eight package also known as Covitz crap roll doors from me. And I'll be talking about what covert crap is and how you as a chiro specialist or as a business can join.</p><p>My name is Curry. Also welcome to Siracha Fe the podcast where I show you the behind the scenes. Of optimization themes and talk with their specialists about data and human driven optimization, and implementing a culture of experimentation and validation in case you missed it. In the previous episode, I spoke to Matt bashal from Carver's CRO about automating those pesky tedious recurring tasks.</p><p>So you can focus on the morphine bars of the job. You can find that episode on chiro dot cafes slash. Episodes or in the podcast app you're listening with right now, this episode of shearography is made possible by our partners, covert online dialogue SiteSpect and content square. Welcome to season two, episode 18.</p><p>So we're all welcome. And yeah, first of all, let's get to know you. what's your background and how are you involved with Shiro? </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:01:25] I'm the founder and managing director of conversionary, we're a CRO and experimentation agency. And so we specialize in, yeah, so we specialize in accelerating conversion rates for, eCommerce companies and Omni channel retail companies and say, And so besides that though, like I'm a, my background is I've been in digital about 10 years.</p><p>and out of that five years, I'm an experimentation and yeah, I'm a, in a CRO breakfast of a hop, ad hoc and loved getting into the tools. Love seeing stuff in the data. but, in a conduit that, all the time at the moment, but, besides that, we have founded this new initiative called COBIT crap, which on are we going to chat about?</p><p>and, we'll talk more about that, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:19] Yeah. Yeah, and your wife or girlfriend is now eight and a half months pregnant as I understood, right? </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:02:25] Yeah, that's right. yeah, married to a lovely woman. and she's about. we are we're one month away now from our first one. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:34] So </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:02:36] yeah, this is great.</p><p>This is great timing with all the COVID-19 stuff happening. I can imagine </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:41] there's some additional stress there. </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:02:43] yeah, it is a bit, yes and no, she didn't get to have a baby shower, which was a bit sad. so we turned it into, yeah, just something, just something virtual, And it, the positive has been, we've been able to spend more time at home. and I've been able to be around a bit more since she's on maternity leave. so yeah, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:05] that's good. Maybe the postage side on this. I, when I was, when I became a father for first time, the little one was, is now one and a half years.</p><p>And I was able to stay at home for the first four months. And that was really great if you're able, if you're able to do that. Yeah. That's great. </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:03:23] Yeah. that's, that's great insight because I don't know what I'm about to face. And, and so yeah, if I can spend more time at home then great. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:32] That's great for a little while.</p><p>And your girlfriend, of course, usually it's the ladies that need to stay at home mom for this and a man need to go to work at the, in the Netherlands. They need to go to work out for five days already. Yeah. I think they extended it to 20 or something. Yeah. But what we're talking about today, let's let's let's assume that all goes fine.</p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:03:53] Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully fingers crossed. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:55] So you already mentioned, coffee's crap. Totally different story. </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:04:00] Yeah, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:01] totally different. Okay. Can you tell us a bit, what is covert crap and why'd you start it. </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:04:06] Okay. So Colbert craft stands for con COVID-19 conversion rate aid package, as in like first aid package.</p><p>yeah, basically it's they movement, but took off, unexpectedly. so it's a movement about so far about, , CRS all over the world now. yeah, we were all banded the CRO industry or the conversion rate optimization industry has banded together to give one, of your time each, to help a struggling business, improve their conversion rates.</p><p>and the idea is. Is that is practical, tangible, help that they can get for free all for free. Yeah. it's amazing how so many people are come together, to do this. and I guess you asked me why I started it. I the inspiration kind of came from, when I was in.</p><p>Just moving out, our team and I were just moving out about coworking center and there was a small company there. they, you like sports consulting, right? A small sports consulting firm. And then, ran the COVID-19 thing. He, we were moving out and I found out that they had to close their doors because suddenly there's no more sports clubs.</p><p>So there's no one to sell to no one to service anymore. And so that told me it was heartbreaking. And that's just one among so many, accomplished businesses now who are struggling, who have lived, laid off staff, who, whoever had to close their doors. So I thought to myself, I'm a, CRO, person, what can, and, we have an agency, obviously, where.</p><p>We were scrambling and doing our own, damage control, but what can I do to help? And I thought to myself, let me just put it out there. Let's say, if I give one hour of my time, let's try and feed that bites. And I contacted, another CRO friend in the U S and two other Sierra guys in Australia.</p><p>And I just said, Hey, I'm about to push this thing out. Really join me. And they said, yeah, let's do it. And I think from there, like a whole bunch of people saw that and, it just a bit while that's good. Yeah. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:12] So all these heroes are helping businesses by, by, offering one hour of their time.</p><p>how is it possible to contribute to a business in just one hour? What are they doing? </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:06:22] Good question. so the idea is that. it's structured. and it's practical help that they can, that a CRO person can provide, to, who was reaching out. So say someone reaches out and they set up a phone call or a video call, whatever that might be.</p><p>And, prior to that, and the Seattle person might ask and a few questions, and to get a bit of background and then, and then they jump on the call, and it's very much like a triaging kind of, phone calls. okay, let's look at how we can improve your website, conversion rates.</p><p>and each person would do it differently. obviously we got 90 plus CRS in there, so all with varying levels of, experience and expertise, but they're all, pretty passionate and pretty good at what they do. and yeah, and we've had some amazing stories where, for example, one, one business I spoke to, and they were, they're an online eCommerce retailer.</p><p>And he said, look, we only help. for some reason our sales are tanking, online. And I said, okay, are you able to share, fill out the form first and they fill out a form. provide a bit of basic details. and then, I asked him for the Google analytics access, prior just read only, had a bit of a look.</p><p>And it's really like in that one hour, trying to ask them questions like, where are your traffic? Where's your traffic coming from? What are your different channels? and trying to stay a bit top level as well. Like how can we. Okay, how can I provide a really solid advice and tackle some big rocks, right?</p><p>yeah. As opposed to, small problems, because a lot of them are just either having zero leads or zero, sales, and we're talking mainly small businesses just to clarify so small businesses who really need help. And so I've go through, say those channels that go through their eCommerce funnel.</p><p>and then just trying to figure out, okay, it seems like you, you seem to have a massive drop off here in here. what have you done in the past? giving them advice on design, on language, on, on. Yeah on. Yeah. On basically bio-psychology elements so they can add, but.</p><p>But at the end of that, they get a Google doc with exactly what they need to change and fix. That makes sense. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:41] Becca, on the front ends, I beta test and happy Oak lost from the beginning of flickering. AFL yachties did come through the key test that was not to be included and imposed test tells that no, Tyler, Sheila.</p><p>be a convert comes our beta testing software. The smart insert that'll heat about any flickering, a full combed fifth gear Snelder support fee, a 24 seven chats. The health would go up and dive at the last minute. It's 15 key carbon positive. You do this yourself. You have a knife and the fork and the &nbsp;during</p><p>Yeah. Are usually a CRO, the internal Shiro people that are, calling out for help or federal Shiro specialists, or are more the digital companies that don't have CRO right now or did, are looking for help with yeah. adjusting to this new world. </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:09:34] Yeah. Good question. I think, it's funny because we have, we have all these experimentation, experts on board, right?</p><p>In this, in this initiative. and, but it's mainly been small businesses reaching out. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:47] Oh, did they usually don't have a dedicated Euro person? </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:09:49] no, not that I've heard of so far. we've had some e-commerce managers reach out. We've had some, heads of marketing reach out. maybe some digital marketing manages.</p><p>but I haven't been, we haven't really. I heard of, I haven't heard of it. I would ask the team, but not a CRO person yet, I </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:09] believe. Okay. Yeah. It's interesting to see because, some companies are actually laying off sheer old people, in this time while others. Are apparently just actively looking for these skills, looking for more data driven way, because they have no idea what's happening.</p><p>they look for more, a data driven way to tell them, Hey, what's happening and how can we adjust to this new situation? </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:10:35] Yeah. absolutely. and I'd like to think that, in the, in a time where was. When a CRO is being considered as a, nice to have by some companies and perhaps, laying off staff or, or perhaps it's, Yeah.</p><p>It's perhaps not being seen tangibly. whereas other companies, I have heard of companies that are investing more into conversion, right? I'd like to think that us as a CRM community and, Greedo, you've jumped on board as well, Good on you. thanks so much for that.</p><p>and then we are all together. give a giving. to these struggling businesses, And we actually making a tangible impact. and the, got some, so many amazing stories, coming through, and NDA, although it's been mainly, it's been small businesses, these are the businesses that really need help.</p><p>And for them to access, one of, one of the experts in the team would, might cost them. normally, okay. Two grand, five grand. Yeah. Just for an hour. Or, even if it's $500 or $200, even that's true money that they don't have. yeah. One another cool story actually just came to mind.</p><p>It was, so Tim Stewart, who's. Who's a well known, conversion optimization expert. And he was helping a, someone, I believe it was a, yeah, it wasn't regeneration business, but, he was helping them with their, with their WordPress website. And even down to the, you need to get into these plugins and you need to, make sure that you have the right it support and.</p><p>and you need to get this website and replace it. really basic stuff. and your code is just all over the place. And so before you, you actually started improving the, the, actual website pages and adding more staff, let's fix this basic stuff, and then you gave them some advice as well.</p><p>and then they were super thankful, sent out, sent out a, a message on the team, put it up there saying, we really appreciate it. We'll be advice and it's made a big impact. that was super great to pin. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:35] And so you all, there's also a Slack channel for coffee's crap. participants.</p><p>And I think I noticed a couple of people saying that, including Tim, I think thing that's not actually CRO work, that we're helping them with it's for some of those smaller companies, there's a lot of more, a little more basic things, that they need to fix first, that it will help them, much faster right now.</p><p>then, we'll setting up, an AB test for sure. </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:13:03] Yeah. that's right. I spoke to, another company, they're a skin treatment clinic and they rely on usually on the clinic and they're the leads coming through the website, but that's, that becomes consultations in their clinic, but they don't have the clinic open anymore.</p><p>So what do they do? and for them, I was just saying, what can you sell online? I said, we can sell some, treatment products. let's start getting that happening. right now it's, this COVID-19 may last a few months and you can't afford to wait around. And you're also very experienced.</p><p>Can you, teach other clinicians your skill sets? And so there's a small business who like, Oh, wow. like that's really useful. Advice for you're. Like it's a lot of the stuff I know that the guys that actually, take cities is enough CRO stuff. but what I love about the CRO skillset and I'm sure you'd agree.</p><p>Agree though, is that because it spans the, the entire marketing stack, As opposed to say another digital discipline. we ended up, CRO professionals. It isn't a position to actually advise on. Okay. What do you need to tackle first? which is really cool. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:19] Like I said, if it's impossible for you to actually perform the services that you did before, because it requires physical contact, think of things, how you can invest in your people or promote your brands in any other way.</p><p>And those are all also great things that you can do right now is to become a better company and a stronger business when this is all over, or at least less severe than it is right now. </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:14:43] that's right. and, if someone's listening out there and, you need help, know whatever it is.</p><p>yeah. Yeah. And if you need help in improving your website, you couldn't be your conversion rate and, or increasing more leaves on your site increasing more sales, right? yeah. We w one of the CRO people within the group can, can definitely help you with the right thing, whether, like you said, Greedo it's, giving you advice on what to tackle first, is it, you need to tackle your marketing first, your advertising first, and maybe then, Implement the advice that they giving you.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:16] So w do you see a certain type of business apply for help? </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:15:20] Pretty varied. and it's mainly small businesses with saying, reaching out. we're really struggling. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:26] do you see certain sectors or certain verticals that apply or </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:15:30] so far what's coming through the, the support and the support request form is, businesses like, let me see missing sports clubs actually come through because obviously they struggling cause they don't have anyone to, anywhere here, they don't run out of opportunities.</p><p>We're seeing some bigger businesses as well. some bigger like design service, design consultants, let's see, say if they're doing service design for retail or for, there was one which was doing that for like universities, but obviously a lot of these big companies are, putting these million dollar jobs on hold.</p><p>They said that their leaves are completely dried up. So that's another example of bigger business. we think he called us a quality commerce come through. I'd say that's the biggest one, right? all from all over from Canada, from the UK, from, the Netherlands from Australia. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:29] So you're based in a, in Australia.</p><p>This is a worldwide initiative. do you also see that the help requests that is different, in different countries? Or is it, </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:16:38] yeah, cause it's. It's it really depends on, on the flavor of the CRO person who's assigned to you. but yeah, one thing I'd say is that the commitment and the, and the deliverable remains the same, anyone who asks for help, there will get genuine advice, no sales speech, no hidden agenda.</p><p>and it's actual, genuine, tangible advice, and it'll all be documented in a Google doc and that's something that they can take away and implement. Yeah. and, yeah, and I guess that, because it's something that kind of literally started all the night and it's just taken off from there.</p><p>we haven't really, Go on through okay. You know what the nuts and bolts of Too deep into how we're giving you advice. I like to leave that up to the CRO person who's providing that. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:23] immense quite a tight and &nbsp;Zana specialist.</p><p>A team</p><p>and ultimately is here salmon Mecho &nbsp;hope, Hama, social websites, sales funnels, and customer journeys for me at info high now online dialogue. So how was that assignment done right now? It's just like ad hoc. A request comes in and I used to use available or. I'm on being local. Doesn't really matter right now, right?</p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:18:01] Yeah. Yeah. No good question. There's a website called, who would crap.org. I do have to applaud and thank Matt, blue shoe for putting in the time free of charge. just. His passion for the cause he's in the U S and he spent hours and hours building that. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:17] We actually have him on the postscript podcast last week,</p><p>but he builds a website. </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:18:24] Yeah. Yeah. He's a, he built a website, and he's still tweaking it. And, anyway, so it's just a one pager it's Kobe crap.org, cob ID, crep.org. And then if anyone listening needs help, or if someone who needs immediate help to, improve their website because they can, you can go there.</p><p>There's a button that says I need help. They can click on that and they can fill out a form. it comes through to, to a few admins, that we who volunteered. And then we assign. A CRO professional in your region. do you, so you can actually get someone in your time zone.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:06] Don't need to be around the corner because it doesn't matter anymore, but yeah, same times on definitely helps. as I understood, so right now there are more Shiro specialists that applies. there was 98 then, so they spend an hour or, they are willing to spend an hour each week, to help companies.</p><p>but there's more, time available from them. Then there are companies applying right now. So what can we do about that? How can we get more companies? To apply for this because I think a lot of companies need the help, but don't know about the initiative yet. </p><p>Raoul Doraiswamy: [00:19:39] That's a great point. And that's like where we w what we want to work towards next.</p><p>Cause right now we've helped about 60 plus businesses. and it's all because of, all the guys that are taking, we're taking these calls for free and, really inspired by them. and that kind of, keeps my fire burning. Now the next step is, so we've done 60.</p><p>How can we get to a hundred? And then once we get to a hundred, how can we get to 200? so at the moment, it's the words spread organically through social media mainly, And, what I'm really looking, looking for. and if anyone would like to come forward is if you can pop this on your newsletter, if you can put this on COVID crap on your blog, someone's struggling see it, right?</p><p>Yep. So we want to get out to as many marketing channels we can right at the moment and. so reaching more newsletters, reaching more publications, if someone who, who writes for a news publication or an online marketing new site or whatever. get in touch with Grito myself. And, yeah, we'd love to, get the message out there and cause someone.</p><p>reading that might see it. And, and that'll give us more exposure and, and more that means we can help more people. So the capacity Quito, you said it was about 90, 90 plus people. but rare, yeah.

Welcome. To the podcast. And, first off, of course, we want to learn a bit about who you are. So, can you tell us a bit about your background and how you rolled into, doing CRO or, CRO related stuff at Convert.com?</p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:00:16] By accident. That's the short answer. so it's no surprise and I, I don't hide it on my LinkedIn profile.</p><p>I used to be a to your architect and, a renovation project manager for high value, renovations. And I came to convert originally five hours a week to do Holacracy implementation as a contractor. It's something I also had no experience in. But what we'll do, we'll dig into that. I'm sure you'll, you'll dig that out of me.</p><p>So I came into this world of which I knew, I knew, you know, I had ideas and I understood a little bit about digital marketing because I had worked in a very kind of archaic and slow moving industry, but you know, understood what marketing and digital marketing did for our business. But I, you know, didn't havereally.</p><p>In depth knowledge of what that was or what it could do. And as I got further involved in Convert, because of our structure, I have taken on many, many roles and learned lots of new and exciting things. And Dave didn't a little bit to this world. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:01:32] Yeah. So, so what did you, what are you currently using that you used before in interior design?</p><p>What are your bringing with you to Convert. </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:01:40] Well, I think a lot of, problem solving, you know, I think it's when you're working in a, in a, in a SAS company, and when you're working in a, in a company that has a lot of, entrepreneurial, our structure is basically a, to succeed, you have to have an entrepreneurial mindset that's, a base qualification.</p><p>And I have an ability to. See the big picture and see the details. So for me, I can easily go in and out between the two. So I can see operationally how decisions can impact, you know, whether it's people, whether it's product, whether it's a cost to our customers. So agencies, for example. and I think that, you know, that background of being able to.</p><p>Please and be honest and cater to while moving projects forward successfully, to different stakeholders and teams is really good skillset to have. And apparently it translates really well. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:02:45] Yeah, that does sound like a good skill, indeed. So for those of you, for listeners that don't know, Convert has been a sponsor of the podcast for a long time now, but can you tell us a bit about what Convert does.</p><p>Sure. </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:02:58] We're an AB testing and personalization tool for agencies and enterprises. Okay. That's the short answer </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:03:09] and the long answer... </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:03:11] the long answer is that we have a tool that developers love, very, easy to use and customizable of, for, you know, if you're inserting code, it is powerful and good value.</p><p>So, you know, that checks a lot of boxes for people who are really looking at the bottom line. And. You know, we, I think we can, we stuck up in complete, compete really nicely, with the other others that I will not name </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:03:44] all those that are probably familiar to all of our listeners. </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:03:47] Yes. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:03:49] You already mentioned you don't really have a title at school for it, as, as no one does.</p><p>but you have roles. And we'll get into why that is later on. but what are your roles. To give an idea of what are your roles at Convert.</p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:04:03] I have. So it's interesting. we're allowed to pick whatever role we want, whatever title we want to have to the outside world, kind of. So the title I have to the outside world as director of operations, I think that it speaks very nicely to.</p><p>How I have helped to grow, convert from 5 people to now 40. We just hired four people in the last 3 weeks and my roles have changed as the implementation of Holacracy has changed through the organization. So I think that the, the title that I give myself to the outside world is very, fair and a demonstrative of what the value I have in terms of the roles that I energize now.</p><p>I think I gave you the list before. There's like nine roles. It is quite the lis t &nbsp;. So I can say that, I hold roles in operations, in sales and success and in marketing. And I am the representative. It's a little bit funny. I'm actually a newly assigned to be the lead link or the leader for the sales and success team, but I represent the members of the operations team in our super circle meetings.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:05:27] Yeah.</p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:05:28] So it's, you have to, in your work, in an organization like this, you really need to be able to compartmentalize and wear different hats pretty quickly. it's certainly not for everyone, but it's, it, it allows me to keep my fingers in a lot of different pies, and really understand what the, the pulse of the organization is and how to grow the business.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:05:48] Yeah. And you don't necessarily do AB testing or experimentation, yourself. Can you tell a bit about what, what optimization or maybe the experimentation mindset, how does it look like at Convert itself? </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:06:02] Well, I think that, so one of the core tenants of our DNA is progress, not perfection. I actually have it, embossed on one of my &nbsp;eags.</p><p>And this is, really a driver for everything that we do internally. So I think it's important to note that, you know, Holocracy as a system is self-steering and self-organizing. So when we talk about optimization internally, we're really looking at, The processes and the process improvements that we can leverage to make the work flow and the make the work better to make the organization better.</p><p>But at the core of all of that, because we're a remote team, I really think that empathy is the core of optimization. It means nothing to understand what your priorities are in a day, or what project management tool you're using or anything like that. If you can't come into your day and understand the context of what you're walking into.</p><p>So this for us is really, really important. you know, we're a hundred percent remote team. We're 10 times zones. We would do a lot of our work asynchronously, and I think that this is becoming, More kind of understandable to people in these crazy times that we're living in. They've kind of been thrust into this, so they maybe understand a little bit of what I'm talking about.</p><p>We've always been a remote team, so in order for us to optimize ourselves as professionals and as role holders. We have to first practice empathy when we show up to work. </p><p>Yeah. I think that's a beautifully, I mean, and that's, that's what optimizing is about, right? The empathy for the end user. how are they actually using your stuff?</p><p>Empathy is a, is really important, for that one. so we're here today to talk about Holacracy and how that's implemented at conference. First of all, for those who don't know the term, what is Holacracy? </p><p>I would say in simple terms, it's an operating system for your organization. So, you know, we think of traditional hierarchies as pyramids.</p><p>it really is a way to structure the work. It's, has. Yeah. It's an operating system. It's how it's built into how we run, convert. Yeah. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:08:46] For me, when I was, tried to describe it to people, it's, it's, it's, it's a weird combination between being very strict on certain things, but complete freedom on other things.</p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:08:56] Correct. Yes. I'm, I'm glad that you, you, you, you understand that differentiation because I talked to a lot of people in this type of format, and they're like. Oh, it's flat. You'd have no managers. You know, they think this is kind of like, we're hippies from the seventies or something. And you know, we, you know, just kind of stuff happens.</p><p>And the reality is, is that it's a very clear and very formalized and very structured, you know, but within your boundary of your role, you could do whatever you want to move the company forward. And that's very liberating, </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:09:36] Can you explain a bit about one of those structures that you have in place. </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:09:41] So, for example, I used to hold the role of HR champion, which is a role that, I gave back and now kind of morphed into something else that someone else energizes it. At that time, I came up with all the hiring processes all the. Ways in which, like all the details for how we were going to find and recruit people into this new system that we were using to run, convert. And I didn't have to ask for permission for that.</p><p>Right. So I think that if we think about it in terms of giving people freedom to do. What they know is the right thing to do. I came on board initially for this whole kind of Holacracy experiment. Dennis &nbsp;(Convert Foudner and CEO) had seen a Ted talk or something like that, you know, one of these like super inspirational things, you know, it's like, Oh my God, I need to do that.</p><p>And he was, at a kind of a crossroads. He'd realized that he had become, the boss that he never wanted to have, you know, he was hoarding information. He was a micromanager. he was always the bottleneck for decisions. And you realized that he didn't even want to work at the company that he had created.</p><p>And there was this shift about, you know, you need to be able to give control and decision making to people and just trust that they're going to do the right thing. and that's, you know, it's been certainly a process to where we are now, but that was kind of that, that was the start for it, right? So I think that when you give someone their.</p><p>The parameters of where they have their power and control and just say, Hey, you know, these are our OKRs. This is where we are, this, you know, our company information is very public internally. It's very transparent. This is where we want to be. Take us there. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:11:51] And I can imagine that for, for someone like Dennis, who is the founder, cofounder of, of convert, it's also, it can be liberating to not have all this, this, responsibility, but it's also very scary, of course.</p><p>Right? </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:12:05] Absolutely. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:12:05] so how. How, how does it go? Maybe you have more experience outside of Convert, so, but how does it usually, go, how do founders handle this? I can imagine that are, yeah, it can </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:12:18] be very tricky. Certainly tricky. you know, I, I'm not going to say anything that I hear that I haven't already said to Dennis.</p><p>You know, I think. When you know, when I started, you know, we had already had the conversation to see if we could give it a go, give it a try. did an audit to see, you know, what was going on, what roles we had, and learning the constitution of Holacracy, which is really kind of, it's the structure of how, you know.</p><p>We operate, whether it's in tactical or governance meetings, so day to day or, and you know, there were more than a handful of times, you'd be like, Oh, but I want to do this, and I don't agree with that. And it's like, okay, but you don't own that role. Right. So I understand that you have opinions about it.</p><p>But you need to trust that you have someone who's going to make the decision that's good for the company, even if it's, maybe it's not the decision you would have made and it's, it certainly takes time. It takes, I think obviously you have to have a willingness there. Right? I don't think it's anything that can be thrust on someone, but I do think that the.</p><p>It's very, it's been very liberating for both him and his co-founder because it allows them to spend time with their families. It allows them to spend time on projects and roles that are really important to them. and. I mean, why would you start a business and want to work on a business when you have to do the stuff that you don't actually like doing?</p><p>Right, </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:14:08] exactly. Is there, as a founder or people listening to this podcast and that they, people working for them, like is there in Holacracy no way as a founder to be able to influence anything in your company anymore besides your own roles or how, how does that work?</p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:14:25] I see. So I think I can, I can collectively hear them like either rolling their eyes or shaking. Right. I think for founders, I say I want to be really clear. Like, you need to nail your hiring right. this is super, super important. Like you have to hire for the right qualities of people who can push back, who can lead, who can set boundaries and expectations, who can take responsibility when things go sideways, right? and who are, natural learners. And then you also have to be able to give some budget, a little bit of budget to roles for them to make decisions that need to be made. and. It's, I mean, I see. Can they influence, I mean, you know, one of the roles that Dennis holds in our super circle is goal gladiator. So he sets the OKR for each quarter and the overarching strategy for converting. It's the lead links for each circle. So we have product in development, smooth ops, marketing and sales and success that then take that OKR or OKRs, depending on where we are, and it's up to them to interpret those and set metrics for them. and those leaders are the ones that, set the prioritization, you know, the defining, defining, relative priorities and, maybe some multiple strategies at the circle level. So, yes, as a founder, I mean, he does have. But he doesn't have the, he doesn't have the power to tell me, Hey, Morgan, you know, you're energizing the role of lead link for sales and success. I want you to achieve this OKR by doing X, Y, and Z. And you know, it doesn't work that way. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:16:34] You can influence your goals, but he can't be influenced the way you try to reach them.</p><p>Yeah. And for those that have no idea what we're talking about, OKRs stands for Objectives and Key Results, and we'll definitely link to some more explanation to that in the show notes. We won't go into that right now. so you already, you mentioned something about hiring. I want to get back to you, on that, in a couple of minutes.</p><p>But, first as far as, so you already said you came on board with converts. and then as well as happy. And that started with the situation they were at at the moment. sort of was a transition. From mum, the holography to Holacracy. So, I can imagine that that's also challenging if you don't start out that way.</p><p>So what were the biggest challenges in changing to this new way of work? Like did people </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:17:19] leave?</p><p>Yes, absolutely. People left. certainly, you know, as I was defining the hiring process, there were definitely false starts in, you know, how to hire a, what to hire for, Elapses on like how to fire people. and I think difficult &nbsp;you know, there's a lot of coaching, right? One-on-one, like for me, with Dennis as well as with me, with his co-founder, Claudio with me, with actual individual role holders to say, no, actually. You can make this decision. We don't operate on consensus anymore, right?</p><p>Like this is kind. If you have your own kind of autocracy here, you could do what you want and it's, It's scary. It's certainly scary, especially when you've been used to one type of management and organization, and it's also too, I think it's, it's scary for, for people because , we all get educated.</p><p>And kind of inculcated in the certain way of working and living in like expectations and culture and hierarchy. And then to tell someone, you know, Hey, just throw that out the window and this is your domain. You can do what you want here could be really scary and also very liberating, right? But it's not like . We grow up in that environment no matter where you're from. Right. Some people may be more comfortable with that than others, but it's not </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:18:52] inate. </p><p>It's both, being very strict on some things and being very liberal on other things. So I can imagine it's for people that are having issues with both ways.</p><p>Like it's, it's too strict right now, or. It's so liberating that I actually don't know what to do anymore. Like you fall back into being really passive and you're being used to being told what to do, and that's not happening. </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:19:18] And there's also, I think, this kind of a paralysis of choice, right? You know, I can have so many of these options, like which one do I choose?</p><p>And it's like, okay, a, B and C are all right answers. You just have to make a decision. And then you just, on the flip side is thought of that is that you need to take responsibility, right? So if you end up making a mistake, like we have a channel for that, it's called fail forward. You would take a decision and it ends up not being what you expected.</p><p>Then in our DNA of transparency, we expect you to own up to that and not going to get fired for that. It's not a reason for someone to get fired. It's, it's a learning experience. It's like that whole progress, not perfection thing that I was talking about earlier. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:20:09] And I assume it's not like that. There's no discretion anymore in the company.</p><p>Right? I mean, there does need to be consensus on something that you do, but it doesn't mean there's </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:20:20] not consensus. There's not, you're not looking for consensus. you're, you have consent. So you're governed by consent. so I think the differences that, you know, in my roles, I am. I'll pull in people with more experience than I do.</p><p>you know, more technical expertise. Certainly, I've never would pretend to be an expert in, you know, our product. For example. I'm not an optimizer, but I do, I can take in the input of what professionals. Have an experience in and then apply that information to make decisions. Right. I say you get into a dangerous place when you don't ask for it.</p><p>When they kind of have this ego of, I know better of, which could be a little bit dangerous, but it doesn't, it doesn't happen very often. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:21:27] And, you also mentioned that, comfort is completely results, there, there's no office. would you say, that the Holacracy and, and having a completely remote workforce, is that a match made in heaven or not necessarily?</p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:21:41] I think so, it's funny, I run a monthly group that is. Specifically for, Holocracy practitioners that are remote and been running the group for, I guess, three years now. And I've always said that it's like such a great match, you know, and I don't understand why more remote companies don't sign up for this. I think that having this, this self-steering and distributed authority model works really well, especially if you're asynchronous.</p><p>Right? I've mentioned earlier, we're like 10 times zones, nine, 10 times zones. I don't even bother to keep up or, to be honest . No, I mean, it can be a pain to try. Don't get me wrong to try and, you know, if we have to have a synchronous meeting, it's, you know, I, and I am now actually starting my days at 7:00 AM in my time zone, because I want to have more overlap with Europe, but that's a choice that I made for myself.</p><p>Right. it's like, yeah, it, it just, because then you're not waiting, you know. Six, 10, 12 hours for someone to come back online to make a decision to talk about it too. You know, things can move quickly. I always like to, and that's, you know, when I touched on the beginning, is understanding the empathy and understanding what you're walking into.</p><p>When I opened my Slack in the morning at quarter to seven, I can see everything, like almost every channel is. Illuminated. I could see so much stuff happened between when I got offline and when I got back on and I didn't have to be involved in any of that. It's like magic, you know, things happen and move forward when you're, when you're sleeping.</p><p>Why wouldn't, why wouldn't you want that? I don't know.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:23:41] I can also imagine that for the people that have been working in a, in an organization that does Holacracy for a couple of years, if you're used to that. Okay. You're ruined for life. </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:23:52] I realized that actually a couple of years ago. I, yeah. I, I said to my girlfriend, I was like, Oh, you know, like, I'm really, really screwed.</p><p>Like if I, if I ever leave, I either need to start my own business or I need to, I can't, and it can't just be like, go to. A place that is organized on Holacracy. So you have to be remote as well. Like, no way. I'm going and doing a commute anymore. Right. So, yeah, </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:24:20] I don't think that's a, that's a, that's a filter on any </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:24:22] jobboard </p><p>it's not, and LinkedIn only recently started doing remote, you know, before this whole covert thing. So hopefully, I hope that through all of the, We get through, we get through the tough stuff of Covad-19. we're able to have real conversations about what remote work is and what it isn't, and about what different structures of work exists, rather than being.</p><p>I'm in a big rush to go back to the status quo. Like maybe we can use some of these learnings about what we liked and what we didn't like about being in lockdown or working remotely or whatever it is to make things better. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:25:12] That will be great. Right. It sounds like a great opportunity we have right now</p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:25:15] I think so. I think that, you know, it's a, certainly that's a, it's, it's not for everyone, but I do think that, we do have an opportunity to have a wider discussion about what work looks like.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:25:30] Yeah, definitely. shifting topics a bit. so, at Convert, you also, preach Conscious business and conscious business is one of your roles at Convert so. Well, </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:25:43] it entails of being the change that we want to see. very simply. there's, so we have a three-pronged mission for convert, for conscious business.</p><p>one of them is for our customers. So we have, always grandfather pricing. So we will never. Fire a customer, for example. I was looking, I would say, actually the other day I was looking at that revenue channel and I, I saw all these code names and I didn't know what they were, and someone told me, Oh yeah, this is the plan where people are paying like $59 a month or something.</p><p>It's like from whatever. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:26:26] I actually saw a, I think it was a LinkedIn or tweet from Dennis this week. He said that we're actually two to customers still around that were on the $9 plan, the initial plan. </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:26:39] Exactly. You know, and that that's like, that's, </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:26:42] and then never sort of grandfather ideas that they never get a </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:26:46] raise</p><p>raise. You leave us, you break up with us.</p><p>It's something else. But no, as long as you're like active and know so. And I love that. Right? So conscious businesses, a couple of things. So for the customer, it's like grandfather pricing and you know, for, for whether you're a single proprietor, you're an agency that you know that we always have your back.</p><p>We're never going to. we're very privacy focused, which I'm sure you know, and probably some of the European listeners know, we really take, GDPR and privacy and security compliance to heart. And we actually, it's default in our tool too, right? So if you're an American user, you actually have to turn those off rather than, having to go into some.</p><p>You know, nebulous sub menu somewhere to try and find the right thing. and then the other thing, the other two components of our conscious business is that, environmental. So we're a 15 X carbon positive, which means that we offset 15 times the carbon that we produce as a company. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:28:02] Oh, is that the goal of like 15 times?</p><p>Where, where did the 15 come from?</p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:28:06] Initially it was one, and then we were like, you know, we could do more than that.</p><p>Since before I joined convert, our servers have always been carbon neutral. We then now also offset all the energy that we use for our applications, convert wide. We have started to actually this quarter, we've started to implement, kind of a bonus where after your hundredth sign-in, we plant 50 trees.</p><p>so I really love that one. and then, so we did an audit with South pole &nbsp;(Southpole.com) , last year, and then we offset that, amount that we produced. And, you know, as a remote company, it's certainly, you know, as a SAS business, it's certainly a lot less of a footprint than you would have for, you know, a product based business.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:29:05] yeah. You already have no, no office, </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:29:08] no office, no commute. But you know, interestingly, our audit does, encompass, you know, the energy, the heating. they got really, really detailed. Like I had to make a whole inventory of all the equipment that I bought for work, work, which in the year that, that year was actually quite a bit.</p><p>and you know, that all was accounted for an offset. Right? So. It's very, I was surprised actually at how detailed it was. And then also, I mean, the other thing we do is, so we have to, we, every core member of convert has, a company card for their budget, for their role and for their productivity perk.</p><p>And we have to send those physical cards. All over the world. So we've offset that as well. Right. that as conscious business, one of the policies that I put in place, for this year is that we no longer send swag to collaborators. So if you remember, I think it was what, last year or the year before, something photo shoot, something like that.</p><p>yeah, so that was me saying, I'm not buying stuff. we have, like for one of our collaborators who, one of our agencies who lives in actually Spain, I did the work and I found, I asked, I had a little questionnaire for him and. Found out a couple of key key things about him, and then I found a local experience for him.</p><p>So it was actually a biking tour to a Hort chatter factory, in Spain. I forget where, but, you know, finding these kinds of like details of like speaks to, Leaving a better experience for the people that you're collaborating with. Right? And you're also doing a better thing for the planet as well. And that's really important.</p><p>the third thing that we do that I, I'm very, very proud of is that we actually will turn down businesses that don't align with our values as a company. So it's not something I think that a lot of companies talk about. I think it's. Some of them do, but I think also, you know, it's kind of this, like a couple of the agencies that I've talked to that we work with, say, Oh, you know, we kind of do that, but we don't talk about it.</p><p>Right. And they like the fact that we do it. So that then they can say, Oh, well, I can't, you know, actually test your site. They're on convert because we won't accept it. Right? So, gun manufacturers, for example, any site that incites hate, or, what's the word? family values. you know, that this is often doublespeak in the U S for, you know, sending women back to the fifties.</p><p>And, Not giving people equal rights, you know, it's like, let's go, let's go back there. When everything, when America was great, you know, these kinds of things. zoos, for example, is another one that we don't, align with and this is now built into our, free trial sign up page. It's actually a lot more explicit than it used to be.</p><p>Because we don't want our awesome tool to be used for making those organizations that are. Optimized. Yeah. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:32:40] We don't only don't fire customers by raising prices with you, also don't hire those customers.</p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:32:46] You know, and we have had to have, yeah. Very selective. Right. I mean, the thing is, you know, before, I would say that our processes are a lot better optimized internally so that we catch these.</p><p>there have been times when we've had to have difficult conversations and say, Oh, yeah, okay. You've been testing for three months on our platform, and we only recently figured out that we don't actually want you, which is kind of an awkward conversation to have, to put it mildly. But, I think that, you know, we, we all have.</p><p>This choice in terms of how to make money. You know, we're not a nonprofit. We, we never, suggest that, even to our own employees that people work for free or anything like that. and I think that it, it falls to the conscious business mentality of really doing better and being better. And. You know, maybe there's some people who don't really care.</p><p>I don't really understand what optimization is, or AB testing music, and that's fine. But in this place where those organizations are also powerful, have deep pockets, are really trying to target micro target the audience that's going to bankroll their agendas. I think that we have a unique place to. Do something about that.</p><p>If it's not something that aligns with us and those are tough choices. Yeah. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:34:19] And I'm speaking of being selective and that also applies to the hiring that you, do already said, for holacracy the hiring process is really important. So I'm, I'm curious, I've read a bit about, about this, on the, on the comfort block, how you guys do hiring, but, I'd like to hear from you, how do you approach this?</p><p>How do you, stay away from having this bias in the hiring process? </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:34:43] Yeah. Do you want to do a whole episode on this?</p><p>So I think so for anyone who's listening, who is moving to a remote center team or moving a hundred to a hundred percent remote team, I think the same holds true for them. And that is think about what's, what your values are and what's important to you. And make your applicants self select out if they are not the right fit.</p><p>It's not about getting a thousand applicants for a job. It's about getting 10 good ones. So hiring takes a lot of time and onboarding takes even more. It's really expensive and in a lot of cases, very mind numbing process. to be honest, it's a, so one of the things that we do. Because we have this, this blend of remote and Holocracy that's super important is we have this three week, we require audio, video, and written, answers to questions in the first round.</p><p>It doesn't matter if you're a developer, it doesn't matter. you know, which role you're applying for if you cannot show. Self-actualization. one of the questions is, tell me about a time that, you messed up and what you learned from it or something. It's a real soft pitch of question, right?</p><p>You'd be amazed how many people either won't or can't answer this in a way. That you'd think would show that they have like read the job description or read about convert or something like that? You know, the other video question that we asked that I think is really great for us because we are a default video on in terms of communication, two minutes to record a video of original content only and teach us something we probably don't know.</p><p>So I don't care what it is. It could be anything. It could be related to your role. It could not be. And you get some really interesting content. You know, someone wrote us a song once, someone showed us how to brew the perfect cup of coffee. someone went on a, did a tutorial on, their secret passion was continuity and movies.</p><p>And, you know, but you know, you have this kind of question. You just like, you get a real sense for how people engage in a remote environment, on things they're passionate about and how they are articulate, right? How or how they articulate themselves. Right? We don't care about the accents. or if you have like.</p><p>Superb command of English. That's actually not really important. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:37:41] &nbsp;This what I also found interesting to read because you're, you require this, the video and the audio, but you're also trying to eliminate bias from the process. So how on earth, if you. I mean, you can imagine, you have a bias against someone from a certain part of the world or against a certain &nbsp;language maybe or accent that someone has.</p><p>you already assume things when you were, when you hear a certain, certain acts and maybe how someone looks on video, and you want to prevent that in your heart. You guys tried to do that. So the </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:38:13] first thing that first round, the only person who sees those three items are, it is the, like for me, for example, when I was HR check would have been me, the actual role that's being filled in the circle of marketing.</p><p>The marketing, hiring person would never see that information. As soon as these people check all the boxes for round one. Of the application process, they get anonymized. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:38:42] So round one would be more a general fit with the company that someone in HR could, assess. Then you move on to the actually job specific.</p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:38:53] so everyone gets a code name, you know, sometimes it's spices. I used to use trees. we've used dog breeds, but we discovered that that was actually introduced bias because people would look up what the dog breed if it was cute, not, you know, it was like, I really like, you know, the German shepherd, but it's not as cute as the Dachshund.</p><p>So, but</p><p>right. so it's, you know, so we go through those, get anonymized. We have a virtual assistant, and their job is to go through and, black out anything, any preposition. Okay. Any, reference to. company name, any location, citizenship, I mean, in every piece of collateral that they give us. It's very time consuming.</p><p>and they do an excellent job of that. Then what happens is the video and the audio recordings go through AI and they get transcribed and everything gets removed from there. So then they get passed on to the circle that's doing the hiring and they can look at the information, the other information, cause those three questions that I talked about are just part of a series of other questions that they'd be asked.</p><p>And they can then say, Oh yes. I liked the, I liked these answers to these technical questions, or, you know, whatever it is, but they actually don't know the genders, citizenship, anything for the candidate. So yeah, it's, but it gets us a diverse team, and I think that, you know, that's why we ended up with 10 times zones.</p><p>It's, you know. It's, it's also too, like I don't make the, so it kind of drives me bananas when I see these job postings that say you must be located in central European time.</p><p>Okay. If I'm willing to work that time zone, doesn't matter that I'm located there. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:41:07] Yeah. Even as if it's in my </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:41:09] I'm a night owl. Maybe I PR, maybe I take care of my parent, my aging parents. And actually the shift that I would love to work is, you know, so I don't assume to make decisions for people about what is right.</p><p>You know, if I have a time zone requirement, then certainly I put that in there, but I don't care where the person lives. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:41:37] those are always work. Or have you had the situation where you said, okay, in hindsight, we could have known this if we hadn't blacked out all this.</p><p>I mean, obviously you don't, you don't want hundreds and hundreds of people, so you don't have a huge pool. </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:42:00] I think that, I think that definitely some of the mistakes that I encountered at the beginning is that I didn't put a values testing early enough. So it was much more focused on skills. And then we'd realize that someone made it to round three and they actually weren't aligned with us in terms of values and vision for the company.</p><p>And then it was like I had just wasted four weeks of my time trying to get someone through pipeline. So realize that actually I'd rather take someone who's aligned, who's maybe skills are a little less, because we know that we've. It's </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:42:41] harder to change the alignment than to upgrade the skills</p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:42:45] we're always. looking to see, you know, are they self-starters? Are they creative problem solvers? Are they goal oriented? What other people's skills? Like do they have empathy? These kinds of things, which we know. Makes good Holacracy practitioners and great remote workers.</p><p>So if you get to the end and you are missing a year of experience for something, or you know you're, you'll have a deficit somewhere. You have all, you check all those other boxes, which makes it really, really easy for you to be a great contributor rather than someone who is an information silo who doesn't play nice with other people, who has no kind of collaboration or empathy skills like that stuff in any environment, whether it's remote or not as super toxic and difficult to work with.</p><p>Who wants that right.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:43:45] what are the, the check boxes you need for people, to match them with Holacracy in general? What are good </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:43:54] character trait for that? having, Certainly they, they orientation got the goal orientation, the ability to, to see details, understand concepts as well. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:44:08] How long does it take on average people that are not used to Holacracy, how long does it take them to to adjust or how long to get them to adjust? </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:44:18] It's not black and white of </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:44:20] course. </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:44:21] There's no real answer. I mean, it's. Holocracy is a evolution. It's like a belief that, the organization of Holacracy One that runs the, the teaching and the resource center for Holocracy implementation.</p><p>We have, an evolution of Holacracy in, it's like this huge, It's a very pretty graph, which I could say to you, and it has these different stages and it's like what you see is across convert. It's like the further we get into this adoption. I see that where I thought, we were in terms of, you know, people or hiring or, process improvement, you know, and maybe I thought we were further ahead.</p><p>We're actually further back. I think that it. It changes. It's a different answer depending on, cultural background, plays a role for sure. even though we're hiring for specific traits, then it's also, we have people who, what I call our legacy members of the team who've been with the team for since the beginning and are still adapting.</p><p>To this new way of working and certainly do an excellent job. You know, there's still deficits there, right?</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:45:44] start with, </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:45:45] yeah, actually we do, we start with, A couple of. So the other thing that we do that I think is not just good for Holocracy and remote work, but I think it's really good for any type of a company, is that we do 90 days in the beginning, and it's very, very clear. Like it's a 90 day contract and it's an opportunity for us to try it out and both of us, it's like you can kind of think that you can.</p><p>Suck it up for 90 days, no matter what it is. If you know there's an end in sight, you know, it's like,</p><p>it's a long time, but you </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:46:27] know there's an end, </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:46:28] right? And you know that it's going to be done on this date. So if you really hate convert and you don't like us, it's like you can say thanks, but no thanks. And we've had people do it. and that's okay.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:46:43] Okay. Can you say the percentage of people that go beyond the 90 days? </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:46:46] It's over 90. Yeah. So over 90, we actually had really hot, really high churn for people who in the beginning for, Hires, and it was pretty bad for retention and implementing all these things that I just talked to you about.</p><p>We've gone from that to over 90%. So even though this hiring process, some listeners may say, my God, that's a lot of time and investment in everything. It's like, hire slow. Yeah. Higher. Yeah, it does. It pays off. And it's like, you think about all that time that you spend and it's like, yeah, 90 days is a long time, but especially if you have, you know, a lot of this is new, right.</p><p>For a lot of people, and we don't dive super deep into Holocracy in the beginning. We kind of give them a taste of what it is and what that looks like. people get a lot of, Transparency. and no, I think that you have to make sure it's good for both parties, right? It's, I think it's, it's, it's arrogant to think that as an employer that we're great for everyone.</p><p>It's not the case.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:48:03] So, for, for both, the conscious business part and all Holacra. What are your, what are the things you're trying to change or improve in? </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:48:10] The feedback loop is a big one. so more of a feedback culture. that is one thing. internally, we're actually, It's actually funny you should say that.</p><p>I just had conversation before we got on this podcast with the sales and success team, and we had a big, we're having a big shift in strategy for a Q3 and so we're looking at how we can actually get better feedback and more streamline our systems. So I guess actually it's both. but really, , yeah. More of a learning environment in terms of feedback, you know, it's a little bit, I think it's, it becomes challenging when you have a very multicultural environment because even if you have people who are entrepreneurial and goal oriented, we still have very different cultural learnings about how we accept and give feedback to each other.</p><p>And. I think that's been something that's held us back and something that I'm working on now, I actually have the role of achievement advocate, which, is the one that's going to be responsible for. Making that happen. So working, working on that, I'm working with, the lead links to think about, you know, how they have energizing calls with their circles.</p><p>Like how we, we have secretaries and facilitators who run meetings like how they are encouraging. Objections and bringing agenda items. So, you know, as a cognitive psychologist, you know, it's all about how you say it, right? So. Do you have any questions as opposed to what questions do you have? Makes a big difference.</p><p>Actually, it sounds something like something really small, but it actually makes a really big difference to the type of interaction that you get with a cross functional and cross cultural team. So small details like that. and. You know, planting seeds to, so like I've done in the last four years, five years, can't remember.</p><p>So in the next 3 to 12 months, we're focused on a couple of different areas for people of feedback internally. And. Having a stronger, more dynamic culture of feedback. And that goes to how you ask questions, whether it's, in a meeting or one-on-one too. Like you talked about in the very beginning, maybe asking for input or con, you know, consensus, you know, what that looks like.</p><p>and in multicultural team, that can be difficult. So that's one of the things that we're working on as a sales and success team. We have, shifted to a strategy of teams over tools. So in this covet environment, we've actually seen, A real uptick in, enterprises coming to look at convert to explore us as an option because we have a really robust tool, and this is.</p><p>Holacracy is actually giving us the, the, the leverage to be able to be agile in this, right? So we can change some of our processes internally on how we are flexible in taking over customers, how we can offer migrations and things like that. And then also what that process and that feedback looks like from the customer or from a developer that's using the tool so that we can be better.</p><p>Placed strategically. Right? So I think that communication and feedback is really the, the, the key component for, we're getting prepared now, but for Q three Q four and then in 2021.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:52:20] Morgan, we're definitely running out of time right now. So my final question for you will be, are there any books you'd like to take to our </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:52:27] audience? Actually, there are a few that I would suggest, and I think one of my favorite books that really changed the way that I think about, teams and feedback is.</p><p>There's, there are two, so Radical Candor by Kim Scott, a really excellent book. It really challenges you to think about how you give and take feedback as a leader. The other one is Reboot by Jerry Colonna. really looking, and, and challenging leaders to work on themselves first rather than their organizations.</p><p>And how, how your, your relationship with. Power, money, authority, all these things need to be, dealt with in a way, and it will really help you be a better leader. so isn't this a very interesting setup for his book? He gives some checklists and things like this, and I would also recommend, for any teams that are listening or, You know, in agencies there, maybe you're working online now, but you're actually, you know, part co-located and part remote. there's a really good book by Lisette Sutherland who's actually based, I think in Amsterdam. it's called work together anywhere. And she talks a lot about, she does workshops and everything like that, but she wrote a really great book on how to.</p><p>Do great work in remote teams outside. So this is like fully outside of Holacracy, but really how to, and as a manager, how to make that work productively. so those are the three. My three top reads.</p><p>Perfect. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:54:23] Okay. Definitely add those through to the show notes. Thank you so much, Morgan. For telling us about more about, the way Holacracy and remote, working can work, in these times, and it can be very beneficial for the company and the employees, and have a nice working environments. and, to hear that, even.</p><p>Or not even, but, in times like this, I think it's a story for company that they've been doing remote for a long time. Yes. Spread the word. This is, this is normal. </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:54:54] This kind of can, and I would just encourage your listeners to think differently about the way that they work and how they can work. You know, when we get out of crisis mentality, the kids are not going to be home.</p><p>You know, you're not going to have two people. Yeah. You know, so it's not crisis mentality. It's real remote work. This isn't real for about Laura. And I think that thinking about that and, and really, you know, scaling your organization or your business to leverage what remote work has to offer is really beneficial.</p><p>I'm really happy that you gave me the opportunity to just speak to your community.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:55:35] Yeah, that's, that's very true. Would you say that this is not a remote work I've been remote working for, this doesn't feel like it's for me, but especially, well, especially because of the kid from 1.5 years old now continuously being at home makes it very difficult. It's not normal. Not the normal situation.</p><p>So yeah, thank you so much. I think this is a great content for everyone interested in this, this topic. And, I think a lot of freelancers and a lot of, CRO agencies already trying, of course now they're forced, forced remote. We're already into, hiring at least a couple of people in our workforce remotely.</p><p>So think this is going to be a very interesting, thank you so much. </p><p>Morgan Legge: [00:56:19] Me too. Bye </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:56:20] bye. And yeah, I hope to talk to you soon. Bye. Bye.</p><p>‍</p>",,225e19f3

Yes. Okay. As much as you like. Ben, thanks so much for joining us on this hero Fe both gas. And of course I think a lot of people will know you and probably when you search Google for zero specialists, it's your picture? That's that pops up.</p><p>but w how did you get started with this year, or you also didn't study CRO. </p><p>Peep: [00:00:25] That's great. </p><p>Guido: [00:00:26] How did you get started? How did you roll into CRO? </p><p>Peep: [00:00:30] I was on like a marketing consultant, bit of SEO, BBC, all that stuff. And then one of my clients actually handed me a book by the Eisenberg brothers, waiting for cat to bark, I think.</p><p>And that was like, Oh, that's kinda interesting. And then started Googling and they had a blog back then this is 2008 maybe. Yeah. And, a few people were writing about it. And then I was, there was an interim and marketing company, mind Valley. That's still around now they do personal development or whatever, but back then they were also writing about their split tests and were, was like make money online type of blog.</p><p>And so that's kinda how I got started. And then when I wanted to start my own marketing blog in 2011, I was just, I knew I need to niche down. I can't just write about marketing. And so I started to basically do some market research. What kind of niches of marketing are not that competitive?</p><p>Let's say. And then my analysis showed that CRO was very uncompetitive, like not very many blogs, I think in the West had a blog back then and yeah. I'm not sure if white or final hand maybe they do. And I like very few, and the articles were very basic. Yeah. Superficial and short and dumps.</p><p>Like I could, I could build something here. And so I decided to start a CRO blog and also by starting a blog, I decided to become a CRO person. And when you specialize in something, You actually start getting better at that one thing. Cause you only do that one thing. </p><p>Guido: [00:02:08] Yeah, exactly.</p><p>Yeah. And that's why, I like to go on stage and talk about chiro, especially in the beginning. I just signed up for talks about CRO, I think in 2012 or something, just sign up because I want to know more about this. And then if they pick me up, I have to actually </p><p>Peep: [00:02:25] do it. I was writing blog posts basically as an investigative journalist.</p><p>Yeah. Like I picked a topic and then I forced myself to do research. Like everything that's been written about a topic I'm going to compile it into a summary posts. That was my blogging strategy at the very start. </p><p>Guido: [00:02:44] I read that basically your blogging strategy was also, if I write an article, it has to be the best article in the world about this particular topic, right?</p><p>Peep: [00:02:52] Yeah, exactly. Yeah. because as I said, The Otter CRO blogs were not very good. And so I created looking internal standards that if I do this write long form articles, every claim backed up by data, all that stuff, then I can dominate. Then the, I did. </p><p>Guido: [00:03:07] Yeah, exactly. and for anyone, that has ever read a CXL blog post, you're very aware that they are in the long form.</p><p>There's usually not a couple of hundred words is a couple of thousand words maybe. And, as someone working in CRO and talking about copy, more than once a week, You probably heard just like I have, that's, the people say, people don't read online. </p><p>Peep: [00:03:31] It is true. They skim, we spend a lot of time looking at texts, but do we read every single word?</p><p>Typically not, but of course it depends on how interested we are in something, like if. If it's like a bunch of fine print legalees, but there's a possibility that I'm signing away my house. I'm going to read everything right? The same way. if you're actually deeply interested in the topic, you're going to read it.</p><p>But knowing that most people are not deeply interested, most people are waiting for in the line and Starbucks or whatever, then you know that they're going to skim. They're just going to just casually browse and then you need to design your copy and write your copy in a way that is suitable for. People who don't read everything.</p><p>Guido: [00:04:23] Yeah. so that didn't mean for you that you just, okay. People just skim. So let's make my articles shorter. So how did you go about that? </p><p>Peep: [00:04:32] the long article, the decision was threefold. So one was that the superficial, if your article is three to 500 words, you can't really add at depth to it. So I have to really go deep and it just, you need more words.</p><p>That's one, two back then there was data, which is still true today that if you look, which kind of blog posts get the most backlinks. SEO back links or most social media shares. It's long articles. There are very few exceptions, Seth Godin, but it's because he's a celebrity, he can write, 100 word articles, but everybody else, I still true today that you need to write long articles to get back links.</p><p>Because again, when other people write their blog posts and they want to link to a source, that's reputable. They look at your longest blog posts. Hey, this seems, dance, this one, </p><p>Guido: [00:05:25] I haven't read it, but it's very long. So it's probably better for my personal brand if I share a long, because it's not as much </p><p>Peep: [00:05:31] interesting people might think that they actually read it.</p><p>Guido: [00:05:35] Yeah, exactly. So what would you say, in general, if you would compare, copy to all the other elements on a page, w what is the impact of copy? how important is. Copy. if we're just skimming and </p><p>Peep: [00:05:49] totally, it really depends on what is, what is the brand, those Apple doesn't need too much copy, even though if you look at your sales pages, they add quite a bit.</p><p>but visual brands, obviously, if it's squishy handbags or whatever, they need less words. But for a lot of, I would say majority of the products, it is the copy that sells them. So anything that is expensive, anything that is complicated, your B2B software or, anything that is not that visual needs a lot of copies.</p><p>So at CSL Institute, for instance, so we have, we sell online courses and we have like more than 50 each course has their own sales page. Then we have PPC landing pages and webinar landing pages, and these are all. Copy heavy. it's like mostly words, minimalistic design, which is like our visual brand is minimalistic design.</p><p>And so we learned very quickly that in order to increase the conversion rate on those pages, we need to make the words better. We need to improve the copy. so for us copies like 90%. If, and in general, like if a couple of years ago, I think, yeah, 2018 or something, we built our own CXL AB test physically library, looking back at all the tests, we've run it over the years.</p><p>And what was it that, What was the test about, what, and we were basically trying to figure out what kind of tests proved to be winners nutshell. Most of the winning tests were copy focused, not like a meal or 2000 word rewrite, but like adjusting wording here, the better headline, better button copy better.</p><p>Presentation better value proposition, things like that. So copy is huge. And obviously there's the Unbounce stat that came out from there. I don't remember how many thousands of landing pages, that they found that copy predicts copy is two times more influential than design. I think copy predicts.</p><p>28% of the conversion rate versus design was like 13 or </p><p>Guido: [00:07:56] something. Yeah. and how do you go about finding where the copy, is well up for improvement? Because I feel for me personally, that it's, not necessarily a black hole, but it's very difficult to find out where a copy is lacking.</p><p>Because if you go to Google index, it's not going to tell you, where are, where your copy, needs. For a lot of research or heat maps. I can figure out where stuff is broken in general. but finding out it's where a copy is broken, how to improve it. That's very hard, not a lot of tests are designed to do that.</p><p>So how would I, what would be your tip for people to go out? How do you go about finding out. </p><p>Peep: [00:08:31] I won't say to it's, it's a lot like any type of conversion research. Let's say that we just look at the website and we're going to see how can we make it better? No. If the website is not very optimized, it's like crappy design and then has typos and you don't know what they're talking about.</p><p>It's very easy to say, Hey, make it more clearer. You know what this is about, and you need to improve this design and this and that way. But if you're, if you have above average design and copy. It's very hard to eyeball it. So what you have now is that you need to do research. You need to do conversion research, quantitative qualitative, to understand what the problems are.</p><p>And so optimizing copy is very much the same, unless it's really obviously terrible. And you can see, Hey, I don't understand what this is about. You need to do research to understand what is wrong with it. the conversion heuristics, like where we need to improve, the clarity is very applicable to copy.</p><p>If I don't understand what this is about, I'm not going to buy. So you rate the clarity, you, and So copy testing is the methodology. It's also the SAS tool that we built the launch this year, which is exactly what it does. Is it asks questions, research questions about copy from the audience that, the, website is intended for essentially to understand where the sources of friction, because, in behavioral design, In order to increase the conversion research, sorry.</p><p>In order to increase conversions, you need to increase motivation and lower friction. In a nutshell. Yeah. So in the copy is same way. what can we do to make it more persuasive and what can we do to make, reduce friction? And how do you find out, we'll ask the people, how do they feel about it?</p><p>Do they feel it's clear? Do they feel that these argument is speaking to them? And so on </p><p>Guido: [00:10:31] and, you with copy testing.com. You're obviously you're collecting, more and more input. Not only for your own site builds a four, four copy doesn't, the clients. So what do you see, is usually the issue with a copy is it's not phrased, right?</p><p>There's is it confusing? is it like, off-brands it doesn't, it's not matching with the overall brand perception? What are the issues that you see. </p><p>Peep: [00:10:53] I would say that, the most common issues is still clarity. As I already mentioned, clarity's people tend to be super vague and especially considers in B2B copy where they, companies all often use big words, fancy words.</p><p>That sound nice, but actually they're not saying anything, like we're, using the. Latest AI technology to improve conversions. And then it was like, what does that actually mean? </p><p>Guido: [00:11:23] what technology? Yeah. </p><p>Peep: [00:11:24] Yeah. what are you actually doing there? And, And is it the Navy, like you don't actually understand so </p><p>Guido: [00:11:30] AI or machine learning, or is that what </p><p>Peep: [00:11:33] Andy and I, and what does, is the Navy testing tool or whatever, so clarity is a big issue.</p><p>Guido: [00:11:38] and so does that mean that people need to be more specific? is that usually the resolution for that </p><p>Peep: [00:11:43] more specific as well as use language that you would actually use? In a conversation with fellow human being. </p><p>Guido: [00:11:53] So people, give you the data. Okay. We want to, want to have this evaluate it.</p><p>Where are the problems usually? is it the headlines? Is it like product descriptions, call to actions? What are people saying? What are people visiting sites usually stumble upon? </p><p>Peep: [00:12:08] I think there are two, two, two, two types of issues that we, that'd be fine. And one is That I call copy blind spots.</p><p>Copy blind spots is that you write all these things about your product or service people read through the whole thing and they still don't get it. They still have questions. So in a normal situation, in a normal, in the physical world, I go to the shop. There's a sales person. I can ask questions.</p><p>There's a back and forth. Online copies all you have. So if your copy doesn't answer every single question a prospect might have, it's, you're losing out on money, but often when you've writing, when you know the product so well, and you're writing the copy about your product, you forget what it's like to be somebody who doesn't know this product.</p><p>So you, you don't mention every single thing. And some people don't come to the site, they read it. They're like, Oh, I don't know, does it do this? Does it do that? And you don't, you're not going to call. You're not gonna File a support ticket and ask, maybe if there's live chat on the website that can quickly sort out.</p><p>But if it's a chat bot and chat bots are usually idiots, like you just abandoned them purchase. there are two studies that I've seen on this where Norman Nielsen had a study saying that, 20% of purchases are abandoned. Because of, poor copying, complete copy and IDC, a market research company, you looked at a bunch of B2B websites and said, even 50% of purchases are abandoned because they don't contain the full information.</p><p>People read it and they still have questions. So copy testing will tell you where your blind spots are, which is huge too, is that people have objections. Like you say something, you claim something and they're like, Oh, I don't know about that. And so unless you figure out what is it that they have, like a problem with, so here's an example.</p><p>There's this company called supply. They make, razorblades and no, the Gillette Mach three has three or four blades, like the mainstream brand that's a, and supply has a single blade, a razor, and a lot of people had. Questions that I don't believe a single blade can actually be as good and their copy.</p><p>They didn't really spend too much time explaining why a single blade is better or like why prefer single blade? And another thing was this, supply blade is $75 compared to, there's a dollar shave club, So 75 bucks is a very expensive non-electric. Razor and people had all kinds of issues with it, all kinds of problems.</p><p>And the copy on the website did not address any single thing. So people come they're like, Oh, what is this made of? Like, where is it made? Is it made in China or America? Or, like all kinds of things. And, if you don't know what the, what problems people have and you have a problem. </p><p>Guido: [00:15:10] Yeah.</p><p>so the copy itself might still be fine, but you're still leaving questions. Unanswered </p><p>Peep: [00:15:15] questions answered and you don't handle objections and online, like in a sales situation, you can, like they say, Oh, I don't know about that or whatever. Then you can say, actually it is so good, blah, blah, blah.</p><p>Because all these things online, you have to preempt, the objection is coming. And so you have to write about it, like address it. yeah. Yeah. Cause that's your only chance. </p><p>Guido: [00:15:42] The most obvious example of this popping up in research was, on a website where, and there's actually, it was more like a, also a cultural thing where we saw that when we tested the websites, specifically with Germans, They always, almost always runs through the terms and conditions page that happened.</p><p>Nowhere when the Germans went through the terms and conditions page to look up for the questions that were on an answer it's a, in the </p><p>Peep: [00:16:08] corporate and delivery </p><p>Guido: [00:16:10] exactly delivery. And okay. if I'm, if I want to return the product, what happened? </p><p>Peep: [00:16:14] Oh yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:16:15] And not that interested in doing that </p><p>Peep: [00:16:17] and all the roses cut the executive at 22 centimeters.</p><p>Guido: [00:16:21] Exactly. That's what they were interested in. And that's something we didn't see in other countries, but still it's, adding that information, for non Germans already had an impact. Also had a positive impact on conversion because we didn't see that behavior, but those people apparently still had those questions.</p><p>so yeah, it might, it will be. That's your website, at least with Germans. </p><p>Peep: [00:16:40] Totally. Yeah. whoever you're selling to, so the way you want to conduct copy testing is, sometimes it matter who the, sometimes you sell mass market products. So basically anybody could be your audience.</p><p>And if you're selling pants, like everybody wears pants. maybe unless your pants are like ridiculous or very expensive. </p><p>Guido: [00:17:00] with everyone working from home these days, maybe less people </p><p>Peep: [00:17:04] might be, but basically the way you conduct copy testing to think about their audience, then you need to recruit them from somewhere.</p><p>if it's mass market, it's easier. If it's more specialized, the beautiful thing about, the internet is. You can go to Facebook groups that are interest based. These are all people who want to lose weight or these people into yoga or whatever. And if yoga people are your audience, you can say, Hey, would you please come?</p><p>May, read my website and leave, answer some questions about it. And then I'll pay them on is like user testing works similar fashion or with B2B audiences. Of course it's trickier because if your copy is about. organic traffic, the can't be just anybody. In fact, we tested this, we had a client who was a, I think a Dutch company who, a service for organic traffic, AI, something, and which we had, regular people read it and also research questions.</p><p>And then they were like, what else? like the daily car traffic have to do with organic food. Like they didn't get it. And before B2B audiences to context like who's reading, it really matters. And so that gets trickier. And so with copied testing.com, our service, we have realized that, delivering B2B audiences is actually some, it's an unsolved problem.</p><p>It's a big problem. so our, the future of the product is actually, like we're getting it dedicating a lot of resources to solving. Delivering B2B audiences. </p><p>Guido: [00:18:35] Yeah. Yeah, because I can imagine that you guys already building your own audiences to test this. But I can imagine that for a lot of companies it's relevant to actually be able to basically give you a list of their audience.</p><p>Totally email addresses too. </p><p>Peep: [00:18:49] Exactly. So using your own panel, my work and your own email list, people, the problem with that is that if they're already familiar with you and your service, There's a bias in there. They don't have all the questions, they know how your stuff works. So they're not actually the best audience to read your web copy and give you data on it, insights on it.</p><p>So you want actually people who have never heard of you. Who are like, skeptical about chat? </p><p>Guido: [00:19:15] depends a bit on what you want ultimately, if it's a B2B environments where people do on the reorder stuff, then that might also be very relevant to just validate it with your existing audience.</p><p>Peep: [00:19:25] it could be, yeah. Yeah. With CXL and copied testing and there's a symbiosis. So we have, some hundred and twenty-five thousand people in the CXL newsletter. database. And so we are recruiting our B2B panel from the CXL email list. So we have a, it's mainly marketers.</p><p>So we have a very strong marketing panel. So any title you want, SEO director, brand people. you name it. We have, yeah. That's easy. security warehouse managers, not so much. </p><p>Guido: [00:19:57] Exactly. That's a bigger challenge and what I want to know. So what are the things when, when running experiments on copy, when we're validating copy, are there any particular things to take into account there versus.</p><p>regular or more visual, copy. I think it's, to me it feels usually it's a bit easier. every tool that can be, quite some things, quite a lot of things that go wrong, different browsers, different, devices of course, copy always feels a bit relatively easier. </p><p>Peep: [00:20:25] Totally. I think you could even set up a test with Wiziwig editors, Yeah. not nothing much difficult there. The problem, One challenge with changing copies. if you think the changing one word will make a big difference, it usually doesn't cause it's a small change. And since people mostly don't read the scam, they might not even notice that you changed a couple words.</p><p>Although I have a seen a very particular case, for CXL, itself where a single word made a huge difference. So I've wrote. So our CXO brand, like we're taking this a hostile brand approach. We were running a lot of ads saying like it's too difficult to CX elicited content and like need to work hard.</p><p>It's not easy. So we're &nbsp;selling it or, and so I've wrote a version of the CXL Institute. Copy that post very much, like over the top, this is too difficult. You're not good enough for this. You're going to fail. You're probably loser. And so I'll use this word bad-ass in the copy.</p><p>I was like, Oh, it takes a real bad-ass to actually go through this. And I didn't think twice about this word. And then when I looked at the results of the copy test, I was floored. So out of 20 people that we tested it on, which is, a good sample for a qualitative, assessment, probably out of 20 people, like 16 had a problem with it.</p><p>They're like singled out this one word. I was like, wow, I even forgot I wrote it. But like they noticed as one word. If it's possible, the one word can trigger. And obviously if it's the headline or a button copy that is more isolated from the rest of the copy, it can have an impact. Yeah. yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:22:08] Yeah.</p><p>It's surprising sometimes how a single element can infuriate people. I had a similar thing with people seeing, w all my only gift store e-commerce, gifting where people have to fill in the phone number of the person they're sending the gift to. Oh, yeah. Mandatory fields, no explanation. And people really got pissed off about like it's it's, I don't have it because why should you, it's a surprise.</p><p>So why are you going to call this person what's happening? </p><p>Peep: [00:22:35] Why are you going to </p><p>Guido: [00:22:36] spend them to really got pissed off? So it's funny to see how small things, things that you didn't think twice about, can take off, people. Do you have, so what I also wanted to talk about, we just talked a lot about, about the copy.</p><p>you've written a book about differentiation, right? </p><p>Peep: [00:22:53] I haven't written about it. I've written the book so far. I only have a blog post, but I started to write a book about differentiation. I started to write one, this last winter and then COVID hit and suddenly. It, it didn't seem relevant anymore somehow at a time, so I left it and, now the time has passed and I guess we're all used to the new normal, I think we're past, like in, at, in the spring times, March, April, there was a lot of anxiety and like what's going to happen now.</p><p>We know it's going to be like this for another year or something. He knows. And yeah, I do intend to pick it up. I have a little bit changed the direction of where I'm taking the book. So basically strategy differentiation and branding. It's like a Holy Trinity. They all play. To get her and affect each other.</p><p>And so I do a lot of reading and thinking about this and, yeah, </p><p>Guido: [00:23:48] but when I read about it's a while your tweets or blogs about this, there seems to be there's a fairly, a lot of frustration almost with. With how, brands approach this and go for sameness all the time or don't differentiate enough.</p><p>So I was wondering, where does this come from? how do you look at this and what are brands doing wrong basically? </p><p>Peep: [00:24:12] I don't know exactly how it all came to be, but if you look at competing companies in basically any mature category, They're all saying the exact same thing about themselves as if they were the only one in the world doing that thing, and size is an easy one to pick on.</p><p>Or if, especially, if we look at super saturated categories, like EMA marketing, they all say, Oh, easy to send in an easy to use email marketing or send beautiful newsletter. One email marketing software, doesn't send newsletters and you can, yeah. It's just baffles me. </p><p>Guido: [00:24:51] We'll do a research and just block out the logos, and just ask people which brand is they won't be able to say that </p><p>Peep: [00:24:59] basically.</p><p>Exactly. And then I tried hard to find. A brand that is truly differentiated in, in SAS. And so I asked a lot of people and often people came back to me and say, Oh yeah, MailChimp. They are really differentiated. And so if you go to MailChimp's website, like everything they say is plain vanilla, something that anybody could say, especially now they're all in one tool even.</p><p>but of course, what is different about MailChimp is that MailChimp is the market leader. They're the biggest. Email marketing, software out there now. there's this really great book, called how brands grow. It's nothing about branding, actually. It's just some marketing studies and it makes an eloquent case where that awareness or market penetration matters way more than differentiation.</p><p>So the fact that people know that you exist. You become part of their consideration set, especially in like in B2B, because when I'm deciding which email marketing software to use, I only consider maybe four or five different ones. And there's a most certainly tools that I have heard of. Yeah. So once you have passed that hurdle, people have heard about you, they know that you exist.</p><p>Differentiation matters much less. So MailChimp doesn't need to be different. Others need to be different from MailChimp. It's the same way. let's say new AB testing software comes out tomorrow. And if it's exactly optimize their VWO or, then it's why would I ever consider this new tool?</p><p>And if, or if it's just like Google optimize. Again, </p><p>Guido: [00:26:43] why would I bother? Yeah, </p><p>Peep: [00:26:44] I would. I bought her with this new tool and this tool is dead on arrival. You cannot come to the market as an unknown, as an upstart in a mature market, and think you can grab some market share. maybe if you spend a lot of money, like it has happened in the CRM category where monday.com came.</p><p>no CRM. This is project management. So monday.com. I don't know how many billions spent on ads or like millions. but like they, I think they bought their way into awareness. So I think it's totally possible, but most of us don't have that kind of money and still, there are no guarantees that, you can buy your way into it know without just burning the money.</p><p>So as a small company, you definitely want to have. Differentiating angles, same with phones, like we have something phones, Apple phones and whatever. If you're an upstart phone making company, like they all use the same Snapdragon, stuff inside. So like why would I use this new brand?</p><p>Unless you are considered a bit cheaper? and you can do that sustainably or, </p><p>Guido: [00:27:51] I think that's great. I think it's, that's our animate, it's a TedTalk and they explain, why companies, that are similar always are in the same location, the physical location. So it's like a car sales dealers.</p><p>Why are they always next to each other? Wouldn't it make way more sense. just to spread out, and they explain, what actually works for them. so we'll be in the same, same location and that's, talking about physical space, but I think the similar, trends, is happening with online.</p><p>It's it benefits those companies that are established already, to become more similar, seminars, I guess </p><p>Peep: [00:28:26] probably cause, let's say how B2B software purchasing works is that. you look at the superficial like features, let's take a drift versus in our car. So they used to have some differentiation.</p><p>Now, if we look at their feature set, basically it's identical. The only thing that's different is the brand and how they positioned themselves. And the drift has changed their strategic narrative even twice now. And I think it's because of the competitor benchmarking, why the sameness occurs is you always look at, how is that competitor different or better than you are.</p><p>And if they have that feature, we're going to have that feature too, which is why the features can never be a sustainable source of, differentiation. And as B2B buyers, they gonna, they're gonna make like a matrix of Oh, how are they different than if they're not different than. then it's about sales negotiation or exactly how all those things </p><p>Guido: [00:29:25] you were at, some books on branding and differentiation.</p><p>I th I think you even said, actually most books are not on about differentiation at all. so what would be a good, is there a book that, that stood out for you on differentiation? </p><p>Peep: [00:29:39] All right. there's actually, there are very few books out there. the classic, differentiate or die. I think that's still a good one.</p><p>Yeah, I like that one. and today basically, if I had to say what is a one sustainable competitive advantage you can have or differentiation is its brand. there's a book called different by a young me moon. And that's about how you can differentiate through brand. that's a good one that I can recommend, but otherwise there's surprisingly little written about differentiation.</p><p>it's it's like a, an afterthought really. And if, and it shows because if you look at, categories, whatever business category is, like companies is so similar, especially like my favorite example is hotels. It's every single hotel has the same type of chicken process.</p><p>And then you go to the room, they having the bathroom to have the same stuff, to have the soap and the shampoo and a shower cap, but no toothpaste, no toothbrush. why. Yeah, why are they all like that? It's because they copy each other. So it would be very easy to just be the anti-pattern, Exceed the expectation. what can a hotel chicken look like if everything was possible and everything is possible? I think, there's some low hanging fruits there. </p><p>Guido: [00:31:09] Yeah. and so branding is, for established companies. branding is the only thing basically that's left, to differentiate them right.</p><p>but for startups, you say you up that's, where your opportunity is if you want to, basically, attack the established order. so one of the things that they should differentiate or our artist specific areas, that are especially effective or, </p><p>Peep: [00:31:31] there is like a laundry list of things.</p><p>There is the, if you're a startup, you can be the first one doing something like, say, copy testing.com is the only tool for this thing. It's not going to be like that forever. like there are going to be copycats and other things. but there is a first to market. advantage that you can ride on for a while.</p><p>you can be the innovator, in a space also like Tesla cars, Tesla used to be the electric car company. Now, of course, every car company is producing electric cars and soon their batteries will be. Same as Tesla. So unless Tesla can play, the innovators came and be always two steps ahead.</p><p>remains to be seen if over 10 years they can keep that up. But, yeah, so that is a way. And then, you can specialize for a specific target market. So you'd say invoicing for, a heavy metal bands, of course there needs to be enough market there to support you, or you can, attribute leadership.</p><p>So attribute leadership basically is that you doubled down for one. Use-case or your Bezar better at some aspect like Zappos, which Amazon bought many years ago, they were known for customer service or WP engine used to be known for super fast WordPress hosting. Now of course, very competitive space, but I think the WP engine still owns that in, In people's minds that positioning.</p><p>So you choose one of the attributes that you want to be, best at. So if I work to build a new AB testing tool, know what attributes could you, Double down on like the best code editor or I don't know, probably not enough, like you need to think about it. so that's, or you make your products in a special way.</p><p>old beer is made like this, but we make the beer that way, there's something different about it. yeah. And of course, customer experience, like customer experience is like brand. Anybody could differentiate on. on experience. </p><p>Guido: [00:33:37] Yeah. And I think, especially in B2B there's there are way more chances to do that.</p><p>companies being treated </p><p>Peep: [00:33:43] well. even in plane services, imagine a plumbing service, cause plumbing is a commodity, like so many plumbers. But what if the way they answer the phone or send you reminders and like you could go above and beyond, like you could really differentiate and when you call there, they could have something going on.</p><p>that is like super VIP service, </p><p>Guido: [00:34:05] Yeah, everything is a subscription these days, so maybe there's a subscription for plumbing and, but it's hard to sustain. It's easy to copy those kinds of things. </p><p>Peep: [00:34:15] Yeah. if it's successful, it will most certainly be copied. there is advantage of being first.</p><p>There's a lot of, examples of being the original, Coca-Cola the original Cola. and so on. but, execution of obviously what are you able to execute on that vision? Because we also know, a lot of cases where first ones faded away, social networks or whatever.</p><p>Of course </p><p>Guido: [00:34:36] we have a lot of guests here in this urography. do you have any maybe clients or people in the industry that you think, we should have on the show? Who should we invite? </p><p>Peep: [00:34:44] Let's see, let me think about the names that I actually follow myself. what would be a good perspective is, cause I think see a row, is still in many organizations, CMS. Insignificant tactical. It doesn't get enough attention, compared to sales or, like something that's really important to big. So it would be interesting to have, maybe even like a panel, like type of thing with some big company, somebody who's has optimist, experimentation built in as a thing and some, or I have a back and forth, as SaaS leader that I greatly admire and follow is, Jason Lemkin.</p><p>He has done SaaStr conference. so hit, he doesn't probably have anything to say about conversion optimization per se. But, it's an interesting business guy. </p><p>Guido: [00:35:39] if you can connect me with him, then that will be a, that would be great that we can ask him, for, to show. And you said zero is often not seen as important as sales.</p><p>I think everyone will agree with that a bit. Why do you think that is? </p><p>Peep: [00:35:55] Yeah, I think there are some narratives about a CRO that have that really stuck with people where. the, your classic, this is the button copy thing, quartet, color testing. And so there's small things have really got into a way of people taking it seriously.</p><p>we need, we </p><p>Guido: [00:36:17] need CRS on the </p><p>Peep: [00:36:17] bigger things for sure. optimism, experiment, cause lean startup as a concept is exp experimentation, right? Yeah. Build measure, learn. we're doing the same thing you say they had the better story and they're talking about it in a bigger scale, like finding whether what you sell is that somebody want to pay for it.</p><p>So maybe see a role. People have also chosen, a smaller battleground, And maybe, maybe, we've been talking about, should we be called something else for a decade, right? Yeah. I think there's still something to it where if it's like the word growth hacking, that you say growth, hacking people, roll their eyes.</p><p>and it started off. Meaning one thing. And then now it's a crypto jerk, it's the same guy as the growth hacker, it's, they're auditory term, more than anything. So maybe it's also like we need to like growth engineering all has a positive spin to it.</p><p>So maybe there's maybe there are, the experimentation, I think has a positive connotation to it. and also when, see a row now with the rise of rev ops, it's, chief revenue officer. maybe it should be called experimentation </p><p>Guido: [00:37:31] term, validation, experimentation still, if, as that's a, for people, expectation also feels somehow has a as a, like a random connotation, like people think, okay, we just do we experiment.</p><p>We just. Try random stuff, because </p><p>Peep: [00:37:46] that's </p><p>Guido: [00:37:46] also not what it is. yeah, it's definitely an interesting discussion on probably something we'll continue doing for the next 10 years. how should we brand ourselves? </p><p>Peep: [00:37:53] Exactly. While still think conversion rate optimization. Yeah.</p><p>Guido: [00:37:57] Exactly. but thank you so much for joining me on the podcast. my final question for you would actually be at something, I at least look forward to each year as the state of conversion optimization report that you guys ever do. Can we expect expected this year too? it's a weird year, of course, </p><p>Peep: [00:38:12] but I think so, I'm not in charge of writing it or doing the research, but usually we ship it, like first week of December or so I think we're going to do it.</p><p>Good. </p><p>Guido: [00:38:24] if the survey is still open, we'll we'll add a link through the, to it's in the show notes of the podcast. Some people can, can sign up, or if the survey is not open yet, but we can just link to the reports directly. We'll do that. Thank you so much. And, yeah, I'll talk to you soon.</p><p>Peep: [00:38:38] Thank you for having me </p><p>Guido: [00:38:39] have a great day. Bye-bye.</p><p>‍</p>",,

And we'll be doing that together with EJI. David Aja is an industry expert and user experience with a proven track record for delivering measurable value to clients. He's the founder of optimization agency experiment zone.</p><p>And before that optimization strategy for a fortune and it's companies during her tenure at the clinic, and she was also a UX researcher for a product that we all at least played around with, which is Google Ultima. My name is &nbsp;and welcome to Shiro cafe, the podcast where I show you the behind the scenes of optimization teams and talk with their specialists.</p><p>About data and human driven optimization and implementing culture and validation in case you missed it. In a previous episode, I spoke with &nbsp;about why empathy is the most important skill for any professional. You can listen to this episode on the zero website or in the podcast app. You're listening now.</p><p>This episode of shearography is made possible by our apartment's SiteSpect online influence Institute square and online dialogue. Welcome to season two, episode 33. So AGA a warm welcome to the cafe. And, yeah, let's start off with how you got started with UX. </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:01:36] Great. Thanks for having me on. So what I do is I do think optimization crossed with user experience research.</p><p>So I started my career as a user experience researcher, and then I moved into conversion rate optimization. I was working at Google for a while and I got the chance to work on the Google optimized product and to see how people do CRO and what AB testing is all about and decided to go and do that. So I worked for a company called Clearhead in Austin, Texas for awhile.</p><p>And then I started my own, I started my own agency called experiment zone three years ago. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:08] What would stand out the most that you, if you think back on looking at how people use Optimizely or sorry, Google optimize. what stands out the most? What are the weird things that you remember people doing?</p><p>AJ Davis: [00:02:19] I was on my team from the very beginning. So I was, we were in a hotel room and California. And not like an actual hotel room we were in, actually, we were in it, we were at a hotel. I like as a conference center and we had a chance to group and teams of seven to 10 people for a Google sprint week.</p><p>So it was falling the standard textbook, Google sprint. So five days of starting from an idea to having a product. And so I was coming to that group at, with the lens of a user experience researcher and asking a lot of questions about who the target users were. And at the time we were just starting from scratch and starting from zero.</p><p>And it was a chance to really learn about all the varieties of ways people use testing. And so I think what surprised me most was how mature some testing programs were in places that you might expect, like news agencies and how immature it was, and other places where you would expect it to be really mature.</p><p>And they might have one person spent a little bit of time thinking about it, but not really having a full system. And what I walked away with was that. why I wanted to go and do this was because it was so cool that we got a chance to do user experience and then have an opportunity to validate that it, in fact, truly was the right decision or not.</p><p>And that's why I wanted to go and take the lens of crossing and intersecting user experience research, where you're thinking about what the problem is, how we might solve it, and then validating whether or not that's true. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:39] So your background is in human factors. how does this connect to Shira? How did you become working someone that works in Sierra?</p><p>Because we usually the up until recently it's hero was not something you could study at any school or college. There's a lot of people here in Sierra with different backgrounds. How did your journey look like? How did that come to be? </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:03:58] So I say economics and undergrad, and my last semester I encountered Dan Arielli and got to interview him for this behavioral.</p><p>About his behavioral economics book. So it was in this economics, journalism class got a chance to spend an hour with him. And really, yeah, I first got exposed to what behavioral economics was. So we had operated in the system of people being predictable and us being able to chart out how people would behave based on market forces.</p><p>And it just planted the seed for me. And I wasn't really sure how that could be applied in the real world. And I went and worked in banking for a few years. Didn't really like that. So I decided to switch career paths and get a masters in user, in human factors and information design. So I was applying the concepts of behavioral economics in the case of qualitative data.</p><p>And then when I finally encountered AB testing at Google, I had, I felt ah, ha moment. everything came together. It was like, I went from being an analyst and really getting into the data questioning if those assumptions were true and then being able to take real world experimentation to understand what's really happening.</p><p>So it all came together in CRO. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:05] Yeah. It's basically a match made in heaven rights, combining those two, fields of work. and then use that to optimize. Or whatever you want optimize as long as there are a of customers, you can do that. and today we wanted to talk about, bringing more creativity into Shiro, instead of being overly analytical.</p><p>I think a lot of people have that Lauren and Liz, background or. I think also in lots of people from coming from SEO, having a more analytical mindset, more data driven, mindsets. so first of all, how would we define creativity in the scene and how would you look at that? </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:05:42] I think what often I, what I've often seen when I talk to other people who do testing is that we're really solution focused and we're trying to justify that solution using data.</p><p>And I think if we all took a step back from that and said, let's use data to define where we're heading. And what the problems we know about are, and then we can plug in creativity to explore different types of solutions. So solutions don't have to be constrained to, I see this particular problem and there's only one solution, but instead of giving ourselves the possibility that there's one problem and there might be a hundred solutions.</p><p>And so giving time and space to explore that. So you can ultimately put the best thing out there for testing. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:23] How do we, how would one develop this and how do would, if you already have some creatives? &nbsp;where people say, Hey, that's very creative because I don't do not see me see myself as a creative person at all.</p><p>But sometimes I have a light bulb moment apparently, and sometimes I'll just recognize a, so how would you find out </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:06:42] to the, to not shoot down ideas right away? what I often see is this sort of if you're in a conference room and you're you have to present your case for something, and then you only, you're presenting one case for one solution.</p><p>And there's not really this opportunity to say, but I might be wrong or there might be better ways to do this. And let's open up that conversation. So when I think about something like a sprint week, you take a week. And the first few days, you're not saying no to anything yet. You spend time literally saying, write down every idea.</p><p>There's no bad idea. Get them all out there and then don't worry about judgment yet. So I think it comes down to postponing judgment and separating the space between this is creativity and brainstorming. And then this is when we're evaluating which things we should move forward with </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:26] just postponing judgments on your cell.</p><p>But also that sounds like something that needs to be. cultural thing that you need to have in your team, right? There's no necessarily that's for just one person. It needs to be &nbsp;and bred by the company. </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:07:40] Absolutely. It has to be something where you can, if you can define the ground rules before the conversation.</p><p>And then keep reinforcing them. It will make a, it will create a safe space or create an environment where people can put those vulnerable ideas out there. They don't have to worry about whether that idea makes them seem smart or informed, but instead you, you explicitly state, like there are no judgments.</p><p>We will delay any conversation. It negates these ideas and instead take something. I would borrow from improv, which I do a little bit of that on the side. and for improv, what we do is we say yes. And so there's this idea of somebody has an idea and you build on it as opposed to saying, no, that's not true.</p><p>This world doesn't have that thing to be true. And so it's even just laying ground rules, like yes, sanding in the conversation as opposed to let's shoot down every reason why this is a bad idea. I know when you do that, it really just creates negativity and doesn't allow people with the myth of Richie ideas.</p><p>Yesterday's brainstorm was so good. I really liked step's idea of running that test on the call to action buttons, making them orange will </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:43] really make them stand out. Don't you think? Yeah. Do you want to design a real AB test winners and achieve enormous conversion of lifts, then stop, brainstorming and take a scientific approach.</p><p>If you can read Dutch, follow the steps that online influence the best seller management book Delta now, and we're all in the office course and become an expert in applying proven behavioral signs. Yourself goes to all my new friends.com for more information and free down notes. I want you to do that.</p><p>If you start working with new clients, And you noticed that they don't really have this culture, they just want, we just want solutions, basically. We just want you to find the improvements and implement them, maybe even, how would you go about trying to get them convinced that adding that creativity?</p><p>AJ Davis: [00:09:33] Yeah, I think there's two tactics. I think one is. You can start with it and say, this is how we're going to do it. And here's an activity and you can come in and play fun place. You're like, we're going to come in and be the fun people. We're going to spend a half hour having fun, being creative and finding new solutions.</p><p>And people actually really liked that. It's a great way to get to know people. You can just like, open up and talk about your ideas. some cultures don't allow that and they're going to say, get to work. Give me those tests. I don't want to have any workshops. I don't need my team. Doesn't have time.</p><p>Yeah. And so if that's the case, then you can delay that and build towards it. So in the cases where it's very transactional in the conversation, they're just wanting to improve conversion. They're not wanting to think about, are we doing the best approach to it in those cases? I like to interject as we're talking about research, as we're talking about AB testing findings.</p><p>So if we see a test that lost, or it had an unexpected outcome, Then we can talk about, are there other ways that we could have approached this? And so you can start in starting those, let's talk creatively about this. I often find that if you take the same problem and you tackle it twice and you don't find a solution, that's when people are open to starting to really have these brainstorming sessions.</p><p>Or to take in some qualitative input, as opposed to saying, you guys know it, you're, you've done this a thousand times. Like I just trust you to find a solution because you're, their audience is different than every other audience. And so you do need that creativity and focus discussion around that particular audience.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:57] When I, get through new clients, I like to do a little exercise called the marshmallow spaghetti challenge. maybe you're familiar with that one. Do you have any other specific exercises to. To yeah. To get them in the mindset of being creative, being open maybe before actually looking at the UX problem that you're.</p><p>AJ Davis: [00:11:18] Yeah. I have some just really basic exercises. I think it's a really important thing to do something like an ice breaker. So that everyone in the room has made themselves vulnerable in some semi personal way. So it might be something like name, your worst haircut you've ever had, or, tell me about your, like the first concert you ever went to.</p><p>And there's an angle of just like opening up a little bit personally and allowing everyone in the room to open up like that sets a standard of Hey, we're human. And we're all trying to work together to do something as opposed to like I'm coming in with my suitcase and my suit. And I'm putting on a show for you.</p><p>so I think that is a really important aspect to just get started on the right foot and to present. The ground rules like we talked about earlier. I also just, I love giving introverts a space to be creative as well. A lot of the times there's just this culture of sitting and throwing out ideas at each other.</p><p>And so I think sticky note exercises are really great where you can sit and doodle or have sketchpads and everyone can sit quietly and then report back. And that's a nice opportunity to go. if you take the time for everyone to sit and reflect individually, and then you go around and everyone presents it before anythings any feedback's given it avoids this like herd mentality that sometimes happens in creative discussions too, where people jump on a bandwagon, cause the first person said it and then those other ideas get left behind.</p><p>So that's, those are some of the principles that I like to operate with is give everyone a chance to think and get it up. Everyone, a chance to speak before, even weighing in on any of the options. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:48] The default ID I would have from a brainstorm session about your exit sticky notes. </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:12:54] Yeah. It's always sticky </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:56] notes.</p><p>when you go, and do these kinds of exercises, trying to be creative, is there. A certain group composition that you would be looking for. That's ideal. Maybe it's certain people you specifically don't want to have in such a session or do want to happen. </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:13:13] Personally. I think having people who represent different, Points of view within the company can be really helpful.</p><p>So from a product background, that would mean having someone from the engineering team, someone from marketing, somebody from sales, like having representation across the board, because everyone has a different experience and lens into your customer experience. And so having those different inputs just lead to very different ideas and then you can feed off of each other.</p><p>what I wouldn't recommend is having a room just of analyst or a room full of just engineers. Like you want to make sure that the group is diverse. I think on the negative side, people you might want to leave out. You may want to leave out, especially in cultures where it's very top down, you may want to leave out leaders.</p><p>You might want people to be pretty much at the same level so that you have a chance to align as a group and then present the idea as opposed to feeling like. People are trying to impress the boss. I think that's the division. So I diverse room from different perspectives and then trying to keep people where they can all be equally on the same equal.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:11] Yeah. Would you also include actual customers or actual users of the product or service into such a session or would it be a different session? </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:14:19] I personally do a group internally. So people get on board with the creative process before bringing in customers. I think often with customers, you want to have the customers talking to each other.</p><p>And so in an ideal, like there's no budget time is open. let's do it the best part thing you would do an internal session, you would do a group with just customers. And then you would do a group where you're mixing customers with internal. So that way you get those different mixings of perspectives.</p><p>there's a tendency. When you bring customers in that they. become the center, fold of the conversation and you, it's they're the boss, right? Like you're there people that you want to make sure feel like your team is smart. So you want to make sure that you can give people really comfortable situations to really open up and talk about different solutions.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:03] Usually those sessions where I'm mixing clients and customers, it's usually, it's not about the session itself. It's more about. Your awareness of, getting those clients aware or the people working in, for example, digital marketing teams aware, Hey, there's actual. They're our customers and this is how they look.</p><p>There's real people </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:15:23] on the other side. Yeah. Yeah. There's the value of bringing customer voices in is just an like unlimited, there's just so much power in bringing them in at the right time and for the right moment. So I think when we're thinking about brainstorming sessions about solutions, I tend not to think about bringing customers in, but you absolutely need them because if their voice isn't in the room, you're really missing out a huge opportunity to learn and to get inspired.</p><p>So maybe in my ideal situation, instead of those three buckets, you would first start with the user research. So you have the data of what, how users are responding to some of their challenges. And then the creative solution finding would be those three things. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:00] And in the overall optimization process, How often would you do these kinds of sessions and when the process of optimization, which you do these </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:16:08] jelly, you do them every quarter.</p><p>So you're always thinking about what have we learned and then where do we go next? And I think quarterly feels like the right pace for a lot of businesses, because you can get through several cycles of solving problems and then reflect on it. So for some businesses that might realistically be once a year and then, and then you're building out the roadmap for the rest of the year.</p><p>But in an ideal scenario, if you're really moving fast, do you want to make sure you take that time to reflect and be creative moving forward? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:36] Of course, a lot of people that do user research, a lot of people, unfortunately don't do user research or at these companies that don't include the jets in their optimization programs, mainly focus on, analytics and, especially to the hard data.</p><p>that they do have from tools like Google analytics or whatever analytics tools they use. And then, do experiments based on that. so what would you say is the value that user research brings to that in general? </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:17:02] I think very simply we get the, what from the quantitative data and the why from the qualitative data.</p><p>So we can always see what customers are doing, looking at Google analytics, but we can only infer why they're doing it. And if we talk to customers and have them think aloud and use a research, we can really get a chance to really understand what's happening and why they're doing it. So I love to bring research in when we just don't know why a test didn't turn out the way it did.</p><p>Like I have a client who's been working at the same concept on their product page over and over for the last six months. And we're at a stage now where we have to do user research because otherwise we're going to have this endless cycle of trying to put something out there that isn't informed by. Why are customers not responding to this very thoughtful approach?</p><p>So for businesses that aren't yeah, really thinking about user research in the process, I think that's the easiest and most natural place to first plug in user research is asking. Why didn't this test perform the way we expected and can we get inspired to do something better and improve on it </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:00] for over 10 years now?</p><p>All my diet of advises about evidence-based conversion optimization with a focus on data and psychology, we see that analyzing data and recognizing customer behavior results in a better online dialogue with your clients and a higher ROI that team of strategists, analysts, psychologists, and UX specialists.</p><p>I've gathered valuable insights in your online behavior of your visitors and together with you, they optimize the different elements of your zero program through redesigned expert reviews, AB test and behavioral analysis. For more information about their services, go to Owen dialogue. It does that. You just see a, like a weird drop of points somewhere in your funnel.</p><p>and it can be very eyeopening to do those. it's very. Fairly easy to start with, right? you can, of course, complicated user research as much as you want, but in a basic user research and interview with someone or just having someone perform well, buying something on an eCommerce sites, can be very simple thoughts that you can just observe people doing.</p><p>And, like I said, you can brainstorm for hours, on why something is the way it is, but you can also just look at those users. Yeah. What are the, what are some examples that you find, that you've gone before, where something was unclear, looking at Google analytics, but very obvious, when you did user research, </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:19:22] I think navigation is often something that you can't get a really clear sense of why people are doing the things they do.</p><p>And if you do a tree test or a card sort, you're suddenly having these aha moments like, Oh, our reflect, our navigations are reflecting our business, not what our users need or expect. So I think navigation's a case where. Over and over every time people are really surprised for the kinds of things So we did a task with a customer where we took some messaging from their homepage and moved it to their product page, and it was value proposition messaging. And it just like a very foundational marketing thing. As you tell customers, why bye for now? And yeah, test didn't win. It didn't do anything. It was inconclusive.</p><p>When we move that content over. So we were trying to figure out why that would be the case, because we saw it in the heat maps that people were scrolling and seeing it, and it wasn't impacting their decision. But when we did a user study on it, we got a chance to get qualitative feedback on how people were responding to it.</p><p>and time again, across all 10 participants, people were like, so what, this is just the same as every other company would say, And so we learned that the messaging there itself, that they had used elsewhere and were using it in their sales and their marketing and all over. Wasn't resonating.</p><p>And so they didn't ever really took the time to reflect on the words itself. And we just thought that we all made some assumptions that was effective. And by the time we got to the point of user research, like it just created this tidal wave across their company of things they needed to go revisit.</p><p>So user research can be really insightful and can really pull back some assumptions that the business has been making time and time again for a really long time. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:57] the most obvious one from my side and the example that I've. just before, is that's, we saw a big drop off in a sort of stuff in, in the checkout process.</p><p>I don't think we had, field stack show. We didn't necessarily see which field was the, it was the problem. Just the Patria I was on. And, yeah, of course there's lots of little things happening on those pages. So you can think of anything in and brainstorm for hours, but we did a user research.</p><p>It was very obvious. there was a gifting company and they, there wasn't this field, that required you to enter a phone number of the person you were sending the gift to. And there was no explanation why the company needed that. And it was. And when we sat down with those customers, like five out of six of the day, they complained, started complaining about, Oh, I don't have it.</p><p>I don't want you to spend the person or it's it's a surprise. So why would you, </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:21:49] what are you going to do? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:50] The surprise? Yeah. Yeah. it stands out so clearly if you do user research, sometimes not always, of course, but some of it stands out so clearly what the problem is on such a page.</p><p>AJ Davis: [00:22:00] I find that every time I deliver a user research report, I'm like, this is going to feel obvious. And it's because it's now obvious. It wasn't obvious it's before. And we got to this point and had to ask and learn, and it's becomes obvious because you're hearing it over and over from customers. But it also makes sense.</p><p>Like in that example, you just gave that there's a lot of. Questions of like, why are you asking this? And whenever you introduce uncertainty, you almost inevitably hear that in user research that they also are feeling uncertain. So set expectations. It's just a good principal set expectations for how stuff will be used when it will show up.</p><p>And then that will remove a lot of that friction. Another study that came to mind was actually a survey that we did on an exit where we were wondering why we were seeing such a big dropoff in checkout and overwhelmingly. We saw that people were leaving because of coupon codes. And it was something that we thought could be the case, but the customer wasn't really clear that made sense because they said, Oh, there's a customer there's coupon codes all over.</p><p>But 80% of the people said I'm leaving to find a coupon. And it really just changed our strategy about talking about coupons. How do we present it? Where do we present it? How do we make it easy? If we want to be a discount focusing brand, how do we make it easy to grab the code or apply the code? So just asking the questions when you're seeing that drop off in data that took five minutes to set up, these things are not complicated.</p><p>The tools are out there now that can make it really low costs to get feedback from customers, whether it's usability study or </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:25] so you just spoke about, you mentioned about, delivering those reports to clients. what's your favorite way of. basically telling them what's wrong.</p><p>what the results were from those, those studies is like video presentation or how would you </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:23:37] go about doing that? It really depends on the scale. So for the example about the survey, it was just something we shared quotes and we did it in context in our weekly meeting and everyone was like, yeah, makes sense.</p><p>Let's move forward. So sometimes I like to present it really simply. So it doesn't feel like an over-thought out resolved. It was an insight, just like an analytics insight, which pulled it from GA here's the data we pulled it from customers here's the data. But in cases like the one I mentioned where it really had a major cultural impact to the business, it was really important that we showed recording.</p><p>So I like to deliver it as a very simple executive summary. So it's easier to share a lot of the time, like C level folks. Don't have a lot of time and are used to flipping through things in email. So we like to have quick reports, quick insights pulled out in the email. A very short report with some summary SIM with some simple takeaways on the first slide.</p><p>And then for people who want to really understand and hear the customer and have the time to do that, we'll build video clips where we'll weave together audio clips or video clips of customers. So it all depends on what you're trying to communicate. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:41] It might also depend a bit on the maturity of the client already.</p><p>How much. </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:24:46] And also how much they know you. So if you're very early in a relationship with a client, sometimes you need to present a little bit more information to build that credibility. And for customers we've been working with for several years, They don't really need us to spend that time to build a formal report because we got the insight we needed to be able to move.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:03] So what would be your favorite, methods of doing research or do you have a favorite or does it totally depend on the issue that you're facing? </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:25:12] So from the lens of creativity and getting to the best pest ideas, I think usability studies are the best. So the reason is it gives you a chance to really see somebody use your product from start to finish.</p><p>And in e-commerce, it's a pretty standard flow for most sites. So it's easy to catch main things that every part of that website funnel. so for me, that's my favorite because it lets me level up all my test ideas. Every part of the site, I'm inspired by some new insights that I didn't have before. And it's a great tool to get a baseline.</p><p>So you can do a usability study every quarter or once a year, and you can keep rerunning that same study and understanding changes over time and what customers expect and how they're responding to the new elements on the site. So I think that's by far my favorite </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:54] with usability study, you mean, inviting participants, giving them a case to work on and do something to walk through websites.</p><p>AJ Davis: [00:26:03] Yeah, I should explain what it is. Yeah. A usability study is there's several different approaches to it. That's where it started was often in a lab setting where people would physically come to your lab, be at a computer. You would sit next to them and you would give them a script and moderate. As they're working through an application or a website, technology has enabled us to do a lot more for moat research, as well as remote unmoderated.</p><p>So tools like usertesting.com, try my UI user interviews.com. All these tools can enable you to just quickly get feedback from customers that are good representative sample of who your target customers would be. So for me, I liked the unmoderated remote studies because you can get that feedback really fast.</p><p>And it's low cost, so that trade off of time and costs to inspiration and insights is one of the best I think for CRO. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:26:55] And when it's online, it's relatively easy to well to segment the type of users you get through. Most of those surfaces. Allow you to pick people from a certain country or certain experience level.</p><p>AJ Davis: [00:27:07] They also let you add screen our questions. So you can ask we've segmented our user usability studies based on, is this a current customer of this business? Is this somebody who's never purchased from them, but a purchase from their competitors, you can tier them based on their spending habits. There's all kinds of things you could introduce into the survey so that they get closer to your target market.</p><p>And you can get insights that say. For new customers. These are things that we might need to do for existing customers. These are some of the things I might expect. And so you can go really deep and start really segmenting down. But at a very basic level, just getting people who are reflect the country, the basic income characteristics.</p><p>maybe certain brands that they've shopped before is a great starting place. It's going to be fine. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:27:53] Marketing here for AB testing has been impacted too. If you want to keep that thing to enterprise standards, but safe, 80% on your annual contract, you can consider comfort. But there's some release you can take advantage of full stack and hybrid features, strong privacy compliance, no blink and enterprise.</p><p>Great security. Feel good about your smart business decision infest. What you saved back in your CRO program. Check out www adult's overbook slash 2020. Comment. I got from a client a couple of months ago. They said we can do a user study, but we don't want to use any of those kinds of services, because those are people that are used to doing user studies.</p><p>Start they're hard. They're very, adapted as going through those, those websites. And those are not, are those not normal users? What would you risk your responsibility then? </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:28:49] Yeah, I think there's two ways to mitigate that risk because it's true. There's going to be some bias introduced because of the way you're doing the recruitment, but that would be true if you recruited people from Twitter, If you decided to post and say, we need people for our study. Let's sign up on Twitter and you suddenly are just looking at the Twitter segment of your customers. So from, for a tool that's unmoderated research, you can mitigate some of those things by saying, how many studies have you done in the last six months, the last 12 months, and then screening out people that way.</p><p>some of those tools will have some transparency. And so that's another thing to look into when you're deciding which tools to use is how much are they enforcing that or providing that insight back to you. And then, I think the other, the most robust thing you can do is to introduce opportunities for people to opt into your user research across.</p><p>Any interaction with your business. So for very large companies, many of them have their own databases for people. When I was at Google, we had a mix, we had our own internal database and we worked with external recruiters and we worked with the unmoderated tools as well. So sometimes it's also just about diversifying where you're getting the insights from.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:55] Yeah, exactly. I think if I can let chance are prefer doing a mix of different, types of research, because then you can mitigate those biases that. Each method has a Nunzio. Okay. But if you still get a consistent picture over these different methods, Then properly refined. we can move. </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:30:12] It's the same thing as why we combine qualitative and quantitative.</p><p>If you just look at the qualitative data, it's not going to give you as much information as putting the two together. So same thing with recruitment, finding participants, talking to people, you can do usability studies plus interviews. Plus analytics, and you'll just be way better off than if you just did interview.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:29] So what would be some things that you're changing or improving in the coming 12 months in regards to the way you work with? </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:30:36] I think what, one of the things we're really working towards is creating a product around this combination of user research and AB testing. We've often just plugged in user research as the relationship develops.</p><p>Because people have a better understanding of what it means to work with a company for CRS services and might be more hesitant to make that investment for research. and we're looking to really formalize and productize that so that every company has a consistent, let's start with user research and analytics exploration so that our roadmap is just automatically elevated.</p><p>Versus waiting several months before we start doing some of that work. So for us, it's, getting the word out and talking about it, productizing it, and having that be the way that we do our services. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:31:18] We had some of those question in there also in our Facebook group about how you, manage billing clients.</p><p>how do you go about that? Is it like a fixed fee for a certain period? Or do you have a monthly retainer or what's your preferred. </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:31:31] Good question. we are doing time and materials at the moment. So we will set a six or 12 month engagement and then we'll work towards that budget and track to at each month.</p><p>So we just, we have a culture of transparency. And so we meet with our customers every week or every other week. And we'll report out on how we're doing against that overall budget. But the short answer is we do time and </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:31:54] materials. Do you have some, goals that you set, as in. We will improve your revenue by X percent.</p><p>AJ Davis: [00:32:02] Yeah. We tend to be talking about, and we tend to frame it in the, in regards to how many different tests we would be doing at which level of complexity. So we might be doing five simple test and two medium level tests and one user research study. So we'll tend to estimate how much time all that stuff will take and talk about those deliverables.</p><p>when you get into the math of calculating the specific revenue, we do estimates based on individual tests. And we'll talk about that, but we generally don't make that part of the commitment or requirement for the program. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:32:34] Yeah, I think, yeah, a lot of people are struggling with that. ideally you would, I think, do it based maybe on revenue, but of course, if.</p><p>It's your hit something like COVID-19 and global pandemic, then you're screwed. and if you're doing a really good job, the client probably doesn't want to pay you anyway, if you do it revenue base, that's also an issue that a lot of, those, sheroes encounter. On the other hand, you also don't necessarily want to do with hourly base.</p><p>The South is also tricky because, it's not scalable. </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:33:01] I think the hardest thing about what we do is that if we're doing a really good job, we're creating so much more value than just what an individual test is saying. So we're in we're creating insights that potentially our whole business can act on.</p><p>And so to quantify that value and to calculate that is, it is hard. And I think all the models have shortcomings for how we can set up those </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:33:21] all models are wrong. Some are useful. So as the final, question, any books that you would like to tip to, to our audience, we have some avid readers or audio book listeners, and obviously podcast listeners, in our audience.</p><p>So what would you like to, </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:33:35] I'd actually like to challenge them, to insert a little creativity and fun. So rather than a book recommendation, I'm going to recommend two books, two games. That are really fun, but still database. So Dan Arielli who I mentioned early on has a game called the irrational game, which is a great game for kind of guessing how people are going to behave and how irrational they are.</p><p>And then there's a really fun game called chardy party, which is very simple, very similar to cards against humanity. And it's all about charts. So you're describing what you're seeing in the chart with different pairing of pairings of words, in the age of COVID we can read lots of books, but it's good to create some interactions with people.</p><p>So I would encourage them to check out those two games. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:34:15] So can we do this online? </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:34:18] I bet you could. Do you know if you each had a version of chardy party, you could probably play it like over zoom. Okay. Okay. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:34:24] So we'll have a look at that. I'll include links to those, those games in the show notes from the podcast.</p><p>So you can all have look at that. Hey Jay, thanks so much. </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:34:32] Thanks so much for having </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:34:33] me. Thanks for sharing your experience with, with UserTesting and being, being a bit more creative and, bringing the two this year. Okay. </p><p>AJ Davis: [00:34:41] You're welcome. Thanks for having me. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:34:42] Bye bye</p>",,1721051f

Like they fell into it and I definitely fell into it as well. so my first job out of uni was a marketing assistant, purely just did it thinking, I need to stop working now. I've gotta be serious now thinking about what I wanted to do. And so just how did they got this role? As a marketing assistant, I was still debate. And if I should go and do science, and I was just working and yeah, came across this CRO function and it was just one person at the time and they were doing things like experiments on site.</p><p>And I thought that sounds pretty good, actually. so obviously science background that really I just did that degree because I really love science. it's like understanding how things work, like looking at data and seeing what you draw from that. And you might see where I'm going with this.</p><p>cause it started to really draw parallels with CRO. it's definitely looking at. Onsite data, looking at behavior and kind of making theories from it and then going away and putting that into test, which is really related to me. And then the kind of final thing you do obviously, is into kind of starts and make sure you've got something of significance to show and not just really was relatable to my degree.</p><p>So I fell into it, but it really. That was something that I knew I was going to enjoy. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:57] Probably one of the few people working in Sirota actually had zero as the first joke. I'm wondering, what's your view on combining qualitative and quantitative data in customer centered research </p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:03:09] when you look at data?</p><p>obviously you'll see maybe why the dropoff is or why the problem area is, or, What's that yeah. The stage of the journey it's causing people to leave or abandon the most. but just because you can see that in the days, that doesn't mean that you'll know what the right solution is for them or what they're after, or what's putting them off maybe.</p><p>And I think, On the flip side of that. Also, you want to be creating new things all the time. You want to be appealing to, new audiences and growing, and making sure you can think outside the box to tackle issues, that uses a haven't, but, also create new things for them.</p><p>So I think it's really good to be creative, to think of a few different solutions, a few different ideas and keep developing new websites in that way. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:55] Yeah. Can you give us a couple of examples that, came from this, the D like new features or new things that came from such a process?</p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:04:04] yeah, Recently, we did one experiment at the moment. We're very much trying to drive, listening to customers, putting them at the heart of everything that we do. at the moment, my kind of favorite thing to do, is to ask them what's the one thing that nearly stopped you purchasing at the end of a purchase?</p><p>I really liked that because it's kind of users who have taken the time to. Go through your website on purchase of you or trade with you. you have two sides of the business. I really love our business. it's about 13 years old now, in the UK and slightly less than the U S it's called the lazy Monsey Bay.</p><p>because basically the idea is there's two sides as the trade side and there's a store side, so users can sell to us and we have a legacy category, And CDs, DVDs and games and box, but we're actually now 70% consumer tax. So phones, MacBooks, tablets, and consoles. So basically I'm a user would go to the site.</p><p>We'd provide them evaluation for any of those items and they choose the logistics. So whether they're going to go drop off at the post office or get Korea to come collect it for them. and then basically as soon as it arrives in our warehouse, we'll quickly check through it all and then we'll basically pay them as soon as we've got it.</p><p>I really look that's one side of it. really, that's the idea of the LEAs Munsey be they just put it all in one box and we do all the hard work for them. They just send it to us and then they get paid. and then basically once arrives, we refer a bit basically. So we changed the case on the CDs and DVDs and Polish them up, for the.</p><p>Kind of tech, check the battery, replaced the screen, began Polish or try and make it look like new, put it in a new box and it's the customer. and we're really pushing a mantra at the moment. That's smart for you, smart for the planet. it allows for the user to get, like new.</p><p>Product, but for a fraction of the price. And it's also given them a second life and protecting plastic, any waste. Yeah. So I'm really loving the direction that we're going in. so massive kind of sustainability message. It's massively beneficial for the customer. so yeah. We've got a lot of customers to talk to them, which is great.</p><p>So like I was saying, we, the ones that kind of do trade in with those and it's yeah. Their items and the one that do, purchase with us. I like to ask them. Yeah. w was the one thing that nearly stopped you. and what was it? The kind of the people that have taken time to overcome that, and they've still gone with us anyway, so they tell us things.</p><p>So what we do see is on us, we saw it on our store side. We have a lot of people buy CDs, DVDs, games, and books. And we also see in the data that a lot of them buy them as like bundle office, because do multi-buyers and things like that. Okay. A few, in the basket. And basically a lot of them were telling us that it's, it was difficult to add to basket.</p><p>They were felt like when they ordered one item, they were having to go all the way back through search and get all the way back through the journey. so that was something that was staring us in the face. it was pretty awkward to do that. So again, we laid out the issue of ourselves and the designers, and we said what are some options we can do?</p><p>Because we can look at other people and see what they are doing to combat this issue, but you never know what might work for your users and whether we've interrupted them that data correctly. So we've experimented with a few solutions. but we managed top of like quiet and easy winner in the end.</p><p>just, I think that was a really nice process ends when it's ask you customers. Think of a few solutions experiment got, and basically </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:26] go into a, you just mentioned the system sustainability, a part that I had a whole discussion this week with a group about that with a company, that tries to become more sustainable and, try to figure out ways to do that.</p><p>So how do you figure out how important that is for customers and how do you, how can you accommodate for that? </p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:07:47] Yeah, so that kind of a lot of listening during covert, especially because that was a scary time for everybody. So we kept asking them and trying to be reactive to that. and we actually have spun up a kind of special project team to look into sustainability.</p><p>So that kind of going through everything from the kind of operations side. So the packaging that we send things out in is now fully, sustainable and recyclable. No waste in packaging, and just listening out and actually we've done a few kind of. Surveys recently about what people think about refurbish tech, because we understand there potentially is a bit of concern for refurbished.</p><p>I could think if you can't go into a shop and physically see the item, you're going to get a, you might think, what conditions are going to turn off? And, is it going to work? Is it fine as somebody just left it in a terrible state and then you just send it out and that's not the case we do.</p><p>Go through a full refurbishment process, but actually something that really came through in the service was everybody really liked the sustainability message. They really liked the idea of protecting that e-waste and plastic waste and things like that. And they had no problems with it being a secondhand item.</p><p>And naturally they had full confidence that we were offering a 12 month warranty on SAC items. actually it's doing something that's good for the planet on the kind of covered and to make sure it's good and definitely be a like new product, basically. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:07] Th w would you say that's, is it already the number one reason people buy from you guys that like sustainability or is it more like a cheap or </p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:09:17] easy to, yeah, I think.</p><p>In the past, we've definitely gone for kind of a price and a trust message. I think it is making things affordable, because it's a secondhand good. but it is no, but yeah, recently we really feel like the sustainability message has been. Really strong up against the kind of price, interest message and move on forward as well, really resonates with people.</p><p>It's a really important issue in the world at the moment, and it definitely should be. And I think people are really responding to it, which is really nice for us as a business. It's a marketplace. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:51] So you app. Before offering their goods and, people, buying that. do you also do a lot of research for people freeing their stuff?</p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:09:59] This is a really important point as well. And something we want to look at. In the near future. So with that journey, when people come and get evaluation on site and they want to trade in and send to us, we're also really conscious of the journey that they have to do offline, and looking at how we can help them there because.</p><p>There are some kind of issues about got through the concept. You gotta find a big enough box and they've got to get themselves. Yeah. Post this. They maybe got a print, a label, or they were at the moment when are there QR codes? they just have to take the QR code and they get the label printed for them, but actually just assisted them.</p><p>They've made that kind of transaction on our trade side when they sell it in. I just want to make sure we can help them the best way we can actually get it to our warehouse to get paid. Cause we know that there are like physical factors they've got overcome with like getting some where to send it off or get in a courier to come to them, et cetera.</p><p>So we're definitely trying to make more effort in talking to them as well in the offline part of that journey. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:58] Yeah. I can imagine that, especially for that part of the customer is that's the offline part is well more daunting to them, especially when they just start out. They're deaf. No idea. Yeah. I can imagine that the online part is just a really small part of that.</p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:11:10] Yeah. That's probably the exciting part because they got evaluate another thing. Cool. I'm going to get paid like branch pounds and then the other thing, Okay. Now I've actually got to try the first half. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:18] Exactly. Do we know, is there a large drop off between people, doing the evaluation and then, actually, sending over and stuff?</p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:11:26] No, it's not too bad, actually. we call it the kind of trade to receive. So obviously when they've traded and then we receive it, and we're actually. Again, have a bit of a kind of project team looking at that at the moment. Yeah. Looking at the kind of most helpful way. And again, it was something we really closely watched drone COVID because we were maybe asking people in some scenarios to go to a post office and that kind of wasn't recommended for a certain amount of time when it was strict, essential travel only.</p><p>we opened up careers completely safe and concept free on the inbound way. Korea was definitely a message we try to push and then we're trying to. See if there was anything we could do with drop off points and supermarkets, because obviously that would have been part of economist essential, journey.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:53] In the last couple of months, </p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:12:54] demand definitely went up for our service. People were at home, more bored. So they were looking around the house or what they could sell. So that was great. And then also, obviously people again were bored and they wanted entertainment. So we definitely actually saw our kind of legacy category of CDs DVDs.</p><p>cause we have had, physical media on the decline. Everybody streams, everybody downloads now, but actually Jaren. COVID-19 that definitely was not the case. Everybody, wanted to be entertained and like they would get the bundles they'd get DVDs, especially for the kids.</p><p>That was definitely something we saw the Disney category, was Booman, which was really interested in really great to see because, don't, I know there's a lot of people that don't want physical media to die. They don't want everything to be streamed. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:37] It seems like you were in a good space overall, with the business rights, not too bad.</p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:13:43] We were, we did, we almost felt bad about it, certain points because we just had a kind of business model that really lended itself to, the kind of whole lockdown being at home, wanting it to be wanting to make some money when it's clear out, cause and all that stuff. So we did, a really great initiative.</p><p>for every tack item sold to us and every tech item bought from us, we donated one pound to our national health service. The NHS, I think by the end, we'd raised about 182,000 pounds. And I think we rounded that up to 200,000 pounds, which was incredible really to be part of. And I'm so pleased, but it would just, We're a business that did well in that time.</p><p>naturally things like call just went up. So we were really happy to be able to give back to the NHS, which kind of where the heroes of the moment for that for us, I would say as a business, we're always busy. It's just the way we are. we like to spend a lot of places at once. so I think what I do really love about music McBrian declutter is, We like to keep optimizing what we've got and keep improving that.</p><p>And always speaking to customers about how we can do better that, but we're really big into like kind of new products, innovation. so we've been working on a few things which are, I'd love to come back and tell you about, but that's been really exciting as well. We've done quite a few things. recently the Academy on the horizon for us.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:06] Final question about the customer itself. What is the biggest or hurdle, that you experienced people having or concerns that people are having? when buying a secondhand goods, </p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:15:17] it is around the quality, and not being able to see it. But what we often find is we didn't don't have a high return rate.</p><p>people get it and there, and we see in our kind of Trustpilot reviews, which we love to watch because that's like roll feedback back from people. is that there really pleasantly surprised with the quality. They really, they say it's like new, like there's no scratches on it.</p><p>It's the battery's fine. it's really great. nobody would tell that I got this. Secondhand for a kind of discounted price. And, but I do understand that I do understand that they can't physically go into a shop and see this. so we try and do our best to give them all the information and the pictures and the understanding that, what kind of product they're going to get.</p><p>But it's a slight challenge, online to do that. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:03] Okay. I'd imagine. But you, as I understand, so you. At least partly partially you check all the products, yourself, right? So it doesn't go from, the shallow to the buyer, immediate, it goes through your channels. So you can check that and even you guys even give a 12 month guarantee on </p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:16:21] tech.</p><p>Yeah. I want to quote this number, right? I think it's like an 88 point check or something like that. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:28] It's taking a while, </p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:16:30] very extensive check with all about graders. They're all, highly skilled and looking out at the device, checking it over, doing any kind of repairs that we need to do. refitting the screen, if it needs to be done, Yeah.</p><p>I've seen them. they look really great. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:45] How have you done any experience? have you checked on which maybe specific elements make the biggest impact? Like you said, you already mentioned trust pilots. you guys give the guarantees, have you checked? Which elements are the most important for those buyers?</p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:16:59] we definitely see that people use Trustpilot Fishel see what other people are saying. I think, I think you should never underestimate and like word of mouth and what other people are saying about your brand and, how you, how other people see you. So we definitely use Trustpilot in the U S they've got BBB.</p><p>so yeah, that's another kind of tourist spots froze. And then I don't know, other kind of. Key elements versus we also have, partnered with Klarna. So they do the pay in three. So that means you can split the cost over three months, which also helps. Cause you know, obviously we're saying the reason for doing refurbished is to try and bring that initial cost down for you.</p><p>So again, that's nice way to spread the cost and make it more affordable. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:43] and are there any other experiments, that you'd like to share with us or experiments that you're excited about to run in </p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:17:49] the near future? We're actually going for quite a few kind of a bit of an overhaul of this site.</p><p>I think. There's a lot of important areas. Like I've been saying about the kind of the product information is important to people. So thinking about, revamping the product page quite a lot, we'll go in for some quite big experiments, I think is obviously important to know what you're tasked and to make sure you can stand what learnings you can.</p><p>we've got. But we basically have got kind of hypotheses coming out of Arias. So we're going to get a move on with some of them. and it did go for these page redesigns, with thinking about, we've done a redesign of our checkout, trying to bring that kind of up to industry standard, help people out there, make it as easy as possible.</p><p>We've basically just gone for the approach. Everybody just wants like a kind of easy, quick experience. Everybody works hard at work when they want something in free time. They just want it to be quick. And yeah, I don't want to think about it too much. So just really trying to think about the site and make sure yeah.</p><p>as easy as possible. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:53] And do you see yourself, using that the background's in biomedical science again in the near future, maybe combined with Shiro or how do you see that working? </p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:19:03] I've got no idea,</p><p>but I don't know. It does have a lot of parallels. It is really interesting to look at what people say and look at data. Maybe something do the sustainability could come in that now biomedical CRMs law.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:54] I noticed that you're a recently followed, a content score squares certification program. I think I noticed that on your LinkedIn profile, and then you're using the tool on a, on the music magpie, How are you using that tool? What are you using it for? </p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:20:10] Yeah. So contents, where is a really great tool.</p><p>I'm hope they'll be really happy that I'm going to give them a glowing report cause I love it. so it's how I discussed earlier with the, you've got your raw numbers from Google analytics and then you got a design at the end. They really help, the kind of middle area about, understanding.</p><p>Basically. How people consume your webpages and interact with your web pages and the journey through site. they've got honestly is a really great tool. So there's like journey analysis stuff. So you can look at the highest kind of session, heavy journeys that have been taken and actually where.</p><p>There you've got good journeys and bad journeys. So which journeys are leading to purchases, which journeys are leading to site exits. And there's a lot around, key page metrics and then zoning. So looking at the elements on the page that people are clicking with, engaging with hovering over things like that, and then it right at the end, just to tie it all together.</p><p>They've obviously got session record. And so you can just piece it all together and watch somebody do that journey and interact with the page. That is a really helpful tool. To look up key elements on your page and which ones you need to bring out in a test. So it's really great.</p><p>Yeah. Feed in that hypothesis kind of backlogs looking at, okay. There's something that's really far down on the page that's being really heavily instructed with. we can see it's actually, when people do see it's really valuable to them. So that's just task quickly moving that up the page. and that's a super quick task and actually, usually period's quite fruitful.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:46] square as a sponsor of this podcast, but they didn't necessarily ask you to do this. This is not a sponsored section and the other tools, what are the tools that you're using, for example, your user research. </p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:21:57] at the moment we also use user Bella who I know are also partnered with content squad.</p><p>so they're really useful as well. I think we've been with them about six months. I really enjoy using them. They have the kind of feedback, element. So that just sits on the site. And if people encounter a problem, they can just click that show is the element that having the problem with, give us the feedback.</p><p>And then obviously they do the campaigns said I do that as surveys and the polls, and they are like infinitely useful and actually crazy task we've done recently, which wasn't really meant to be a task. Was. We basically wanted to put a survey up on a kind of the evaluation page on trade.</p><p>So where people will say, like my phone is on lock to any network and it's a good condition and you're going to pay me 400 pounds. We wanted to just put a survey on that page. Just saying, is this kind of all the information you need? Are you planning to trade with us? are there any concerns, talking about that offline journey, like what are their concerns about actually getting that valuation and getting it to us?</p><p>but we know that page is quite important, so we didn't want to just stick a massive obtrusive survey in the way. Cause like popups are annoying. Yeah. So we run it actually as an AB to ask so to control, they just had the normal page, naturally the barrier, they had the survey and.</p><p>And honestly, the way this turn of events, when we showed the survey, it was actually performed better. I just said if it wins, so we're going to just show a survey all the time. Swap. Honestly, I just, we thought maybe people. Like when they asked their opinion, makes them trust us.</p><p>Mom makes us think that we actually, we say like the service is gonna help them deliver a better experience from other people's field. What about that? And think, actually, like these guys do on, a better experience for me. Yeah. Why they're asking these questions, not doing it to be annoying.</p><p>that was. Oh, it was very strange task, but I was glad we did it. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:50] The numbers improved for both people that actually participated in the survey and also for people that just saw it and clicked it. </p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:23:59] Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:59] Yeah. They were just happy about you trying to get better at what you do. And that's just that notion that you tried to get better is enough for her now.</p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:24:09] Yeah, apparently that was really nice. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:12] We can just all put a fake surveys on the website and then, okay. Garlic don't read them. Don't use them. There's just, </p><p>no, that's actually, you start doing something with it, but yeah. Surveys are, very useful of course. And, that's so that's what you use usability for those, the user surveys and, insights.</p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:24:30] Yeah, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:31] usable and square. We'll be very happy with your endorsements, Emily. Thank you. thank you so much. Any final thoughts you want to share with our listeners? </p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:24:42] Everybody in the industry just keeps sharing their experiences. Cause I just think that's the best way to learn. You never know what people are going to do.</p><p>So if someone's got something they can let you know and give you a heads up on that. It's great. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:53] Yeah, exactly. And thank you for sharing your experiment results on LinkedIn. That's indeed. I think a very, very, nice thing to do for all of us in the industry, share our wins and share our failures, </p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:25:04] same way, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:05] share the things that surprised you, Emily again.</p><p>Emily Oliver: [00:25:09] thank you very much for having me. That was great.</p><p>‍</p>",,

Thank you for having me here. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:00:06] Yep. Yeah. Okay. </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:00:10] Thank you. Thank you for having me here. It is. My pleasure. Yeah. so I am tracking Brita. I'm a guy from Barcelona here in the show. I am the SMR president, being as a Mark, the lower community of the market research and insights and analytics.</p><p>in the world. So we are present in the hot 100 feet pantries, more than 6,000 members around the globe, but impacting 100,000 people or more in the whole community. And I work also for, for a Spanish company called net West that we are data collectors, in law, in Spain, France, Italy, Germany. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:00:46] And w what kind of data do you collect?</p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:00:48] So we born as a digital collector, Creating access panels. So people are willing to participate in surveys or tasks. Like we were asking. We're very focused on having them very well profiled and incentivizing them properly in a very nice, unfair relationship. And then we move to the more developed surveys.</p><p>So we acquire a batch company in 2014 for white Cooper that had a software that can trace what people does, what people do online. I'm a wine, Oh, always with consent, of course, and informed consent. And with the whole information. And incentivizing them. Of course. So now we are collecting huge data sets because we can track what people do on their laptop or their mobile.</p><p>And this is the way we can serve. We are in this observational, basically of passive data. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:36] And, this morning, you had a session here at the me conference and you gave the audience a global outlook on the vitality of the data revolution. So what would that, what was that about </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:01:47] evolution? we are in the forefront of sort of evolution.</p><p>the Congress office from our Wars in September in Edinburgh, they like history and they like to dig into history. So I was inspired by the Scottish enlightenment in breasts, but this alignment of what's a fantastic moment in which the sports really had an effect on the world. They changed the world and just many people.</p><p>And among them, I'm a Smith just will mention that. And Smith and Tim's ward. So he was telling, look in the first industrial revolution, there was a concept created a new concept. That was the capitalism, the new concept that really allow the revolution. And the second one was the power was a steam machine, also promoted by James Walker, Scottish guy.</p><p>So we had these two pillars, the fourth industrial revolution, and they do believe that the fourth institution, the one we are now, it's an revolution that is transforming. The way we create, share and expand the value is completely throughout the digital capabilities. Now we have two pillars and if we look at the mindset, it was capitalism in the first industrial revolution.</p><p>I believe today is human centricity having the few minutes center. if we look at the power is data, as everybody says, power, they visited the current oil, but not only data, I would add data drastic data. So data that you'll have collected with via the trust of people and doing the things properly. So the two pillars of the fourth industrial revolution for me are, customer centricity, people understanding and thoracic data.</p><p>And who else is better positioned for this, that Margaret searchers insights professionals that have been for more than 100 years, treating people with respect in terms of understanding what they do and managing data. Yeah. And </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:32] it's not getting easier for us data professionals. This is if, with specifically GDPR, everyone seems to be against us </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:03:41] browser, are coming in the next few years.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:44] Exactly. ITP ATP. </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:03:46] Yeah. But I think this is an opportunity. we, as professionals have always said on several related putting the bar high, if anybody could do that would be easy. Yeah. So this for us is an opportunity to differentiate ourselves from other industries. For instance, the UK, data protection authority just released last year in a report saying that they are super concerned, extremely concerned about the amount of data that is being shared without the knowledge of people and the deep, the deep data that, in terms of deep of observing what people do.</p><p>That was for the programmatic industry providing news and Promatic advertising industry. So many things have been done there in properly. We as professionals in the micro research and insights profession, we must do things properly. We have to construct these pipelines in which information or data just troubles.</p><p>Yeah, we must do that, but we must be very careful in doing that properly and really respecting the rights of people as citizens. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:04:47] how do we do that? Other than following the law? Is that, are there things we should do or need to do ourselves? </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:04:53] I always say that we are just in the infant, in our childhood regarding technology.</p><p>we have got drank of technology for the last 20 years. what's like an eras and now we are just waking up saying, Oh, Whoa, what happened? What happened? yeah, it wasn't hung over. Maybe. technology has really blown as a way, wow, we can do so many things. And now we are discovering that stuff.</p><p>So many things also have a cost related to it. Yeah. So I think that now we are just at the beginning of they're standing the impact of technology in our lives. And for instance, GDPR, for me, it's has the first attempt to rule this. I believe that more or will happen because we're adjusting the childhood or maybe in the teenage, maybe you already says now thinking, okay, Now we have understood, when the humanity started to be in life in, on earth.</p><p>what was the life span was 20 years. So people, every three years was repeating the same learnings. When we pass from 20 to 30 years, there were some people that had experience and could tell the guys there 10 years, Hey, look, don't eat this. Don't go this way because you will have problems.</p><p>So these people were really. Important to the evolution of the humankind because, okay. We are learning. So I think we are now still in this 20 years of span. And now some people say, eh, don't go this way because this way is dangerous. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:15] And what do you see happening in a, say the next five years?</p><p>Further than five years for me, it's like the next five years. What do you expect? But what </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:06:25] are you guys working on? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:26] for them? Yeah. What are the projects groups within the organization? What are you working </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:06:31] on? so the one, so the subject that is really steering the whole industry is the end client.</p><p>So the end user, because there is a transformation there. we all know that people want to be, have better information to take better decisions. In a much more in a faster way. Oh, so these are parents, everything and India cheaper because there's also this new mindset, which is everything is doable and everything is cheap or wait is not that cheap.</p><p>so what is happening now is that people want it's faster yeah. To take this issue. So what we are seeing is that because of these digital live we have under, this is like a public, this, we have to collect data. every time it will be less necessary to ask for data that we must have four different and spend time to dive into the whys, dive into the world.</p><p>we observed you are doing all this. Why are you doing, why do you prefer this? So a combination of observational data, plus a more qualitative data. And of course there is now a spend alone from the end client that wants to insource the sense that do it yourself. Is a big trend, okay, we don't need to have so many internal years told me that middle man.</p><p>So we'd have been sourced and all these pipelines to make sure information or the data trail from one side to the other. But for instance, this week we have too many, two very relevant pieces of news. One is the culture of the championship. You know what it is. So he was the he's apart a while it was this antivirus.</p><p>Software that you could install on your lap, desktop for free. Great. That was to defend you, to prevent you from having virus, but they were in this hall of information terms that they were delivering. They were capturing everything you were doing. All right. Your laptop. It's a library. Yeah. Yeah. how many people was using that information?</p><p>Because it's, it was millions </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:08:23] of people. And what was the name? I will </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:08:26] have to check, sorry, my memory, maybe it's mixing too many languages. Yeah. Avara a V a R </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:08:33] F antivirus. </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:08:34] Sorry. &nbsp;I've asked. All right. so this particular day of championship has been closed down, so there's a big effect.</p><p>And the other one is Google's announcement on, closing the third cookies. Third party cookies. Yeah, I really do. So these are very relevant names suddenly. different data lakes with these appear. So how will we react that? Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:02] And, so your organization, is collecting those concerns, from your men members.</p><p>And then, you think you do research, but you also take this to governments, right? </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:09:12] So SMR is, is a nonprofit organization, for members and companies. so yeah, we try to. To elevate those interests in front of the legislator. our mission is to educate the legislator, to make them understand what we do and how we do things.</p><p>I'm assured them that we are in good shape, where we professionals were not doing nothing. Badly. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:33] so how often, does your organization talk to legislators and think, Oh my God, they have no idea what they're talking when I'm talking about </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:09:41] no, very nice process. We have a responsible, between Brussels and Amsterdam community and it's taken us like six years to have now a very important place in European union meetings.</p><p>So we were starting talking with, let's say, of his officers. From a certain rung and we have been upscaling with errors. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:10:03] yeah. </p><p>yeah. And now they, they discuss things with you when it's, when there's a data issue coming up too. so you can help them understand. That's what it is.</p><p>They're talking about why people use it, what they can do with it, both good and embed. And if they want to make legislation about it, what would be the good way and what would be the </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:10:25] wrong way? Yes, that's it. We are sitting at the table, which is important. We had elections for the European parliament, which has recently.</p><p>Yeah. So the whole team changed. So now we are rebuilding all of this, all these connections and networking, but now we have the learnings and these learnings are exportable. Europe is the most active player, but the rest of the world is also following the pattern. So in India, in brassy, Japan, Australia, Singapore, Africa, we are using these experiences and learnings to help also other parts of the world because there's a marriage worldwide.</p><p>It's a worldwide organization. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:00] do you feel like politicians are actively reaching out to the organization to get information or is it still about you guys really need to push this on their agenda? </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:11:12] You mean politicians? Yeah. Politicians are very concerned about in Europe about sickle cell. On the rights of citizens.</p><p>Now, it's something that's been copied in other countries. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:21] are they actively looking for information on this that we can, or you can. </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:11:25] they are aware of the problem and they want to tackle the problem sometimes is lag. If you want to cut a tree and do just well with the bulldozer and think they whole for, so we have to make sure that if they want to get that tree.</p><p>Yeah. Is that signal? What is the tree? How they have to cut it? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:43] that sounds like when we just spoke before the recording, there's this proposal, in the USA, that's. Yeah. Any kind of research, any user needs to, give informed consent for that. There's not only online, that's for every kind of research, but also scientific research for, universities, that, participants should give informed consent.</p><p>Which basically kills the whole, research, because yeah, for a lot of those research things, it's important that the user does know what it's about. Otherwise it's they already have a bias for the research. but yeah, that sounds like the bulldozer. Yeah. Yeah. </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:12:20] We are learning. We are all learning about the facts of everything I showed this morning.</p><p>For instance, a wall street journal, sorry, New York times in December, they released eight. In a row articles were interesting because there were some, people working in different apps, the U S that were alarmed by the quantity and the depth of the data they were collecting.</p><p>So they released anonymously to the New York times, 12 million people data yeah. Have their cell phones and you could trace everything through indeed, that Trump, you could really, they're just very nice. These are things you can follow. I've been </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:57] thinking about it in Europe. We have this Austrian, that goes up, against all the big companies that, okay.</p><p>give me your data. And then, I think there was a couple of Germans also that's requested like all the data from their telecom provider and, basically showing them. W older GPS data for the last five years, </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:13:16] but these are not telecom providers. This is your app for your fitness app or whatever.</p><p>It's not even the Telekom. Yeah. And this is because the technology allows to collect everything they do. So what we have to say, no, we just have to collect these data that has a purpose and it has to be limited. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:13:34] and, also if I install an app, I am not automatically consenting for you to.</p><p>Resell that data to anyone you want. That's it. even if you only collect the relevant data, I still don't want you to just sell it out to insurance companies. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:50] Yeah. And that's also why. so I had a discussion a couple of weeks ago. I was a guest on another podcast. &nbsp;ditch, both guests and that we spoke about, I also have ad blockers, and all like it goes three or whatever.</p><p>And not necessarily because I don't want that. The website, I visit not to collect my use data. I'm actually, usually I'm fine with that. That's fine. But I don't want them to sell it to whatever advertisement party and some websites are horrible. Usually with Ghostery, they're reporting on all the trackers that are installed.</p><p>Sometimes it doesn't even fit on my screen. </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:14:24] I just presented this morning. some slides of others. We have run two studies, asking consumers about privacy and how they feel about privacy. that the Netherlands was one of the countries, 10 countries that I was always one of them , people. So the main computer, if you are transparent, if you are transparent, you gain the trust.</p><p>If you can trust them, people are willing to participate and to engage and to share. Otherwise, if you are a bit blurry, people are not, they don't have the trust. so it's a very strong message for companies and brands say, look, you have to work and being very clear and people treating people as adults and being clear, okay, we are going to collect this.</p><p>And for this reason, I don't worry, we are not going to do this or that. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:15:06] Yeah. And what is, for ASMR? what I like the main points you're going to focus on, let's say in 2020, for example, are there specific things or countries or, Yeah. What did you want to achieve this year? </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:15:20] Okay. My main objective.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:23] This is your final years of precedent. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:15:25] Yeah, we talked about it. </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:15:29] Yeah. It's only two years. Yeah. It's an election. It's an election process and it's been fantastic by the way. so my main objective is to get to communities closer. The community that is the more traditional people came from the motivational space of market research and the community coming from the more.</p><p>Data analytics, data scientists, digital technology got part of the equation. These tend to be more new generation, more modeling to data, more related to how to work with data. The others come from the generation that they really understand the purpose of the survey or the purpose of the investigation or the work they understand the needs of the clients and understand what are the answer because that's stuff that they need to deliver.</p><p>So we, I think we have to become more methodologic agnostic, have a very open view. Okay. Okay. What is your problem? let's find an answer. I don't care. What are the metrics that we'll use? What they have is to bring you a valuable answer for you to have a double decision to take the good position.</p><p>So my main objective is to bring these two collectivities together to help those people that come from the more traditional space together. into this new era of digital and also give the new digital professionals, this vision and this broader view of what is this all about?</p><p>Because sometimes we find that this new community is very much into data. They love treating data, working with data, but they need to have, say a superior perspective or, okay, this is useful for what we need to understand. What is the business question that is behind? Get the response. Yeah. with these lakes of data, you can really get to crazy places.</p><p>You find correlations that have no meaning, but you'll have fun. You go on that. Maybe you can take bad decisions, so you need to have this way. I call it that we need translators. We need people that can translate these two worlds. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:21] Okay. how do you see, the maturity of the industry, in Europe versus the rest of the world?</p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:17:27] Well, Europe is. The traditional market is very powerful, very diverse as well. So let's say us it's quite interesting. they tend to say that you as is more quantitative and have it stage is more. Okay. Let's give me hard data. I know I want to have a number. Do U S is more tense Europe. Sorry.</p><p>It tends to be more like, okay. We have to understand the why. and Asia is just jumping. they have this reality of more traditional, but also jumping into the new. Did you tell like very fast when I told the world, I am, I like to provoke. Okay. I am provocative. Sometimes being present is hard, but I am provocative.</p><p>And when I, is it </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:10] a </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:18:12] rebel spirit? Yeah. Got that one rebel spirit. so when I told the world I tell Americans, look, you need to repeat it. We Europeans have to save the world. We are the ones who saved the world. So they look at me. So they look at my friends. they like it and they're going to be like, what did you say?</p><p>Yeah, I look at listen, China, the three main powers, China, us Europe. So China drinks treats people like you, American free people like consumers. The only ones that treat people like citizens is zero. if we want to save the world, we have to be strong in Europe, keeping these values very high, be provocative, but in a way in that way, summary.</p><p>Alright, cool. Nice. I have no </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:19:00] more questions there. That's very clear. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:02] Yeah. That's sounds like a big, there's a big, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:19:04] yeah. One year is not going to be enough, </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:19:09] but it's about setting.</p><p>let me finish with this. Symbology was giving you before. I think it's very nice. traveling the world, you learn a lot of things and you meet very interesting people. Brilliant people here, always people I like to talk to. No. Yeah, you are a wonderful market. Yeah. And so I was in Mexico.</p><p>I visited this topological museum, which is one of the Western world and it's on Mesoamerican cultures is amazing. So I got immersed in the midst of American pre-Columbian period. So there was in 15, 19 is when the clash of cultures of court. So he was like, Martians came to earth and to communities. Yes.</p><p>So it was the Spaniards getting into Mexico. What is today? Mexico then actually learn Mexico city and the asterix ruling, all these parts of the world. And the assets were a very sophisticated country culture. Sorry. The Nazi land, the current Mexico was like Venice. It was built on a Lake and you have all the candles and you'll have all the markets and zoos policies.</p><p>Everything was fine. So he wants to catch up mixing a clashing. So the way they started to talk is because I've not got this landed in Yucatan, which is the South area of Mexico, very bad. So he got a life in prison. This lady, my LinkedIn is one of these feminine characters in this story that has changed the world.</p><p>A few people know. So Malinchak, she took her as a slave. She could speak my young, of course it was my young and she would speak as stick. And then you had, another Spanish breeze for &nbsp;sorry. he had been, she braked there, so it had been there for awhile. He couldn't speak Maya, so they arrived to Mexico city &nbsp;they start to talk and the way they talk was, non Cortez spoken Castilian for that from a &nbsp;to Maya and from Miami, by Melinda to Astec to the King, that moment, the King was super powerful.</p><p>they asked the King was super powerful, but he used to. Speak like a child. So when he was meaning, for instance, my people don't, my people don't love me. He was saying, I am very feared. people respect me. So he was using this contrary side. it was not </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:21:20] literally saying what he meant. </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:21:21] Yes, that's it.</p><p>But you have to know that. Yeah. So in this moment they meet and he says, you a Spaniard, you are welcome. This is yours. And the translation was literally this one word by word. What he was meaning was you get out of here. I will tell y'all don't even dare to do anything. That was a real meaning. Yeah. So these bad translation had a huge effect, as Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:47] and at least that did the translation, right? there are quite some videos I think on YouTube and I like this is a, like a fun business, thing to do with your team just to stand in a line. And then one sentence and one sentence to the next person and the next person gives it to them.</p><p>Number three and number four. And like after 50 people, it's something completely </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:22:07] different, but that's what we need today in our industry. We need these translators that can really translate the motivational side with the digital more techie side, because we can't afford the clash of cultures. You mean, must get together.</p><p>We must work to have this holistic view and understanding of people, which is what we are here for. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:22:26] Yeah. You want to prevent the total shutdown, right? like the proposal in the U S like saying, okay, we're doing informed consent, no data collection at all. If we get there and it's going to be really </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:22:36] tough.</p><p>Yeah. We did. We professional has to know what they do for what the article is about. Yeah. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:22:44] good luck with that for the next 11 months. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:22:46] Yeah. </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:22:48] I would say I would like Barcelona to win the champions league, but I'm afraid that's difficult. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:22:55] I don't think, in the Netherlands we have any chance of winning it as well.</p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:22:58] no, I don't think so. Last year was a year. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:23:00] Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:03] Keep that in mind. Thank you so much. Have a lot of fun here at the conference. </p><p>Joachim Bretcha: [00:23:09] Thank you.</p><p>‍</p>",,

And of course we'd love to start with getting to know you a bit more. So let's get started with how you go in full with zero.</p><p>Dave Powell: [00:01:38] Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. If we rewind the clock back many years and way back to when WAP was a thing, building websites on mobile, which </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:47] yeah. WAP you were talking about. </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:01:49] Yes, indeed. I studied at Bradford university. And, it was very new for the time. It was a BSC and internet product design, what that means.</p><p>And it was a, yeah, we focused on electronic imaging and media communication, which was a very broad umbrella for study, but it's army how to code, how to use Photoshop, generally, how to produce content, how to communicate an idea digitally. And that set the foundation for really focusing in the end year on internet product design.</p><p>And, yeah, I left there and I began just doing firm and jobs really. got in websites way back when I was still a problem. and from that, yeah, I just mainly did from our jobs. And then I, he eventually came to the Netherlands and, it got a job@booking.com. That's how it all began, which was.</p><p>Maybe even 15 years ago now. So it was right back in the beginning. I think it had just changed into bookings. So yeah, this is well before, before they got bought out by Priceline. So that's where it all really started. Yeah. Working on the affiliate white label program there. And, yeah, we were styling the content to look like, yeah, the affiliate's website </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:59] booking is often mentioned as one of the big examples of how to do a CRO or optimization or experimentation.</p><p>How did you experience that? 15 years ago? What was it like? </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:03:09] Wait was a massive turning point for me because coming from a bit of a design background and also having this, purity for us, vettix, things need to look great, but it wasn't always the case in terms of Sierra and it was where form meets function.</p><p>But then if it's really selling very well, does it need to look pretty and it addressed some fundamental issues for me. coming from the design background, which sort of threw away some of the role box. And I was like, This actually works. The customers are buying it, convert. it makes sales.</p><p>So what better way to move forward in a career than actually using science best design decisions? Which for me, yeah, it really is. It really sparked my interest. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:54] And now you work for a, Kato's a bit harder, our team, team look like and what you're working on. </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:04:01] Yeah, I'm in the ecom team.</p><p>we're mainly just looking after sometime.com. we have websites all over the globe all over the planet, different countries and, yeah, we basically take care of sales through the website, but, our particular focus is on replacement sales from the email database. So we have a big team. It's about 10 of us, but we're in a smaller team.</p><p>There's three of us that are best, concentrating mainly on reselling. getting all the customers that have a device or how the device to get a new one, that's what our Fox is. Just the three of us. We've got a front end developer. We've got me, which is one of those T-shaped people. And we've got another t-shirt person next to me, Ariel.</p><p>she's also very good with, with analytics. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:45] Yeah, I can imagine that, when, when the pandemic hit that's, people drove around a lot less. It did have a big impact on you guys or. </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:04:53] It had a massive impact. we also have the traffic index. sometimes all about maps and traffic data.</p><p>And, I was actually looking at the TomTom traffic data. That's not part of my role, but it's just interesting to see the level of, traffic drops. So significantly the minute lockdowns began to be imposed. So I was comparing, Amsterdam and London then obviously not, even reached the lockdown yet.</p><p>It was insane to see how. How the graphs just really tight. Yeah, it's phenomenal really. But on the flip side of that, when the lockdowns have eased up, people have more, they're going to choose a car more. So we've seen a huge increase in people using CAS because they don't want to use the trends and these kinds of things.</p><p>So it's had a downside, but it's also had an upside once people. Are free to roam, so to say for awhile. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:47] And how has it impacted your work? Could you just continue on what you were doing before, or does it have a massive impact also what you were actually doing? </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:05:56] at that point every Sunday, everyone was very shell shocked.</p><p>We didn't really know what to do. AB testing didn't seem. Feasible people will not on the website. people will not buying things. So yeah, we really had to take a good look at what we were doing at those times. And we thought it would be a perfect opportunity to pick up the things that you can't necessarily measure that you can't necessarily say, this is worth that.</p><p>So in that time we shifted to a different. Different platform. we were working loosely with react, but we, created all these new templates for a sales page. and in that creation, I switched to using a fig because the developer, he said, Oh, we should try using this. It's gonna decrease the times that we've, that we've got from design to, into actual code for it being live.</p><p>So we managed to shave off an optimize that process. That we were having. That's what we were looking. We're looking internally to see how we could optimize our own workflow. again, things built faster. so yeah, I taught myself Sigma. with the prototyping, you've got really into that massively obsessed even, wonderful till, so we built that, I got stuck into content square, cause I didn't never really had enough time to really dive deep into it and understand it on a fundamental level.</p><p>I spent a lot of time looking in content square, and then I'd worked out these, yeah. These floods that were, that were happening, that were seen in the replays and then using figures to solve some of those problems. And then, yeah, it was, we're producing quite a nice little flow between them with this, with the insights.</p><p>And then yeah, we were obviously feeling the backlog, but yeah, during those times, it. It really helped us to do the things that we wouldn't necessarily have had time to do. So it was a good thing. I think </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:42] you made good use of the time. You usually have a backlog of things that you. Think of a okay.</p><p>If I have time, sometime in the future, I can do those things, those basic things to fix workflows, to optimize my own stuff that you never get around to, you started picking up those things, right? </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:07:59] Even one of the jobs that I picked up and we didn't have one repository of all the images. from past, from our past devices, we didn't have it there.</p><p>The was scattered about everywhere and they weren't PNG. So I took two days and I stripped them all our P and G's are looking nice. I'll figure the file. So yeah. Got it. Got things organized. We really did. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:21] That's something you normally wouldn't do, or normally wouldn't prioritize, if you have other things to do.</p><p>Dave Powell: [00:08:27] Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:27] you talk about fake Mar I see it come up a lot lately. Okay. Tell a bit about the tool. What does it do? How people in chiro can use it? </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:08:35] it's like sketch, but it's also Excel, the online version. You can actually work on the design collaboratively. It's not saved on your hard drive somewhere.</p><p>So I can work on the sand file as a developer, I can work on the same file as the copywriter. It's the same file. So you can see them live making the changes there, which is never been seen before it's never been done. So yeah, the point of collaboration it is it's absolutely phenomenal. And the logins that are being built for it.</p><p>It's anything that you can think of. it's just, it's developing so fast and it's also it's free. if you're a small team, two or three of you, it's ideal, pay for software. everyone likes that I'm not paying for it for over 10 years now. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:22] All my God at Pfizer is about evidence based conversion optimization with a focus on data and psychology.</p><p>Dave Powell: [00:09:27] We </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:27] see that analyzing data and recognizing customer behavior results in better online dialogue with your clients and a higher ROI that demons strategists, analysts, psychologists, and UX specialists gathered valuable insights in your online behavior of your visitors. And together with you optimize </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:09:45] the different </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:45] elements of your zero program through redesign expert reviews, AB test and behavioral analysis.</p><p>For more information about their services, go to Oman dialogue. So it's basically a SAS version of sketch. </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:10:00] Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:01] So do you use it to, actually create designs or is it more like prototyping or </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:10:06] I would say I use it for everything now. So even if we've got an email they'll come in and the London page, I'll try to create the whole flow so that what we're looking at, how does it fail?</p><p>how is it experienced by a customer? Because then you can really, with a fine tooth comb golf through the copy, then you can say, Hey, copywriter. Do you think this flows and you're all looking at the same thing, the same experience from email to landing page, because our email department's slightly separate from who builds the London page so that there can be some things that don't quite match, but in this instance, then everyone can collaborate around the stand fail, and that show it's got continuity for a customer.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:48] It's a freemium model, right? So you start on free and they do have paid options. Yeah, which started $12 per editor per month. I see. Depending on the package, but, yeah, it's easy to get started. It's a, at least it's a great way for hero to basically communicate with the designer and developer on what needs to be changed.</p><p>Dave Powell: [00:11:07] Absolutely. even in that you can, create duplicates of things. And say, this is version and this is version B. This is what we want to test out. Yeah. even once you've, you've built your design, you can see how it actually works. It feels how it reacts. So yeah, even in then you can plug it into to maze.</p><p>I don't know if you've heard of maze it's that's also a UX kind of analytics tool you can set. yeah. Goals for, for a customer to do you see this website you're interested in buying something. please find out if it comes. With a magnetic Mount. So that's the goal that you can see the customer's gone in the recording, solid clicks.</p><p>So you can even get UX analytics. Yeah. Macy's is also free analytics </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:52] also freemium model. Yeah. </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:11:53] Yeah, it is. Yeah. UX analytics, just a very low cost let's say. And you can get insights and validation before you've even really called it. Anything, which. I think that's key these days. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:05] I haven't heard of a major before, so I'll definitely check that out at all.</p><p>I'll add the link for everyone, in the show notes. mostly your work on retention at, at TomTom. So w what would you say, what are the most, what are the main drivers for people? a two to one, the replacement in the first place, and then B. what triggers them to actually, buy the upgrade for me?</p><p>Dave Powell: [00:12:27] the business model in the past, we, the older devices you used to have to pair for map updates. that was a big revenue driver for us. but of recent years, we've started to, sell the devices with maps installed on them already. And then the updates just gone, periodically.</p><p>that was something that we actually surveyed customers, way back when we first started all the optimization. What was the reason for you purchasing this device? So it's all the decisions that we've made ed and all the messages that we are sending out is based on customer feedback. Iteratively. So what we, you think that we're saying on the website about these devices?</p><p>And what, how we were selling. It wasn't necessarily the reason that customers were buying it. So we did lots of surveys. We keep doing surveys and we keep like the top five reasons, the wow factors of why people actually do purchase something. So in effect, customers tell us why they purchase it. And we highlight that message.</p><p>In different ways and communicate it to other customers, which haven't gone through the whole process. Oh, it's not re it's a really, I did know, they've read the small print or whatever, and we've just elevated that message. And then rolled it out and seeing sales increase. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:48] What are a couple of those reasons?</p><p>do you know them? </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:13:50] Yeah. The fact that they don't need to pay for the maps anymore, because yeah, that was a big thing. And then the maps were outdated and, obviously it's not a good experience. having a device that, the maps are not up to date and also a lot of customers really enjoy, the updates over wifi now that there's no need to plug it into a computer anymore.</p><p>Cause that was quite a lengthy process. For those times, biggest screens is also, a key driving factor because the more you can see it's the brightest screen, it's just at a glance. You can really see the road ahead and the change in situation. yeah, from a safety angle, I use one.</p><p>So I, I really enjoy driving. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:14:28] Yeah. And I can imagine that they'll start to the whole customer expectations changed a lot in the years that the devices are around now, people also use the using their mobile way more using a maps. Apps on their mobile. And that might be the thing they compare it to, a while as, before they might went on top started they compared it to just a book in their car as just a whole different thing.</p><p>Dave Powell: [00:14:53] Yes. Very nice stuff. I think we're going to talk about our comparison tables a bit lesser on, but, I really that's. That's the key. That's a nice one. Yeah. Yeah, he's a true, the technology has moved along, very much And we, we accept that people do use mobiles, for the navigation purposes.</p><p>but for me, talking from a personal standpoint, I like a tool to be for that in particular. For me, my phone is my form. I don't want it there. It's designed for navigation and I find some of the others, then they're not as good in my view. because sometimes I've been doing this for the longest amount of time.</p><p>They've got a lot of data on it. They're still around for a reason. Cause I think they're very good at mapping data. but it is interesting to see the big shift to mobile. And I think it is much a younger audience, definitely sticking to this and yeah, to be fair, it's not a market that's going to last forever.</p><p>I appreciate that. And then, but on that, you've also got a lot of people that got. In belt navigation and the cars, and that's invariably highly out of debt and really not particularly good. And I'll give you an interesting example. I hired a car when I was in Spain and that had an inbuilt navigation thing and I just couldn't use it.</p><p>it was impossible. if you can take your portable device with you, pop that on the windscreen, you're in a foreign country, device works, you got that. You know that you can relax and know how are you going to navigate in a different country. So it's still got its uses where, necessarily inbuilt stuff doesn't work.</p><p>I think you get used to it. what you like. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:27] Yeah. That's the interesting part, right? So you can use that feedback from customers not only to improve, visually your website, how you sell stuff or retention part, but also feed that back to the company. Saying, Hey, we get all this feedback and it's not necessarily the website that's limiting people from buying was actually the way our business model works or the harder product currently work.</p><p>That's hindering people from actually buying this. Like you said, a with people don't wanting to, download a map update, you just want this to automatically happen. So let's feed that back to product. And hopefully they can fix it. </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:17:06] Absolutely. I can't say any more on that topic. absolutely. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:10] yeah, actually that's fine.</p><p>that's I think greater and I think that a lot of. the mature Shiro themes, are dealing with this more and more that's usually with the CRO, the usual starting point. This is the websites, because that's where you at least own a, it's an old channel and you have a lot of data there.</p><p>That's a point where you have a lot of data. so it's relatively easy to starts here or there, but often, very quickly you'll see that the website might not be to bottleneck. I need to, look for other places in a funnel that, which might be the product itself. So what would you think is an insight that you might have that you don't think others have?</p><p>In our outside syrup. </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:17:51] my main thing of the past couple of years has definitely been, like I said, I was gonna mention it comparison tables. I feel like such a geek saying it. And because again, I get excited about it now because who would get excited about, I could embarrass the table.</p><p>What's </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:05] wrong with me? </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:18:06] You do Dave. I do. Yeah. yeah, we've done so much testing now on comparison to evals. That I find them absolutely fascinating and sell the customers because we've looked at EEG data, they put the helmet thing arm, and then we watched that levels of joy and frustration. And these things really help customers to understand the difference between things.</p><p>And there's so many different ways that you can actually, they lay out the information to make it a clearer, less clear, an answer, questions that people have about. Is it features, is it benefits? yeah. And you can see the levels of joy that it helps them to understand something that's fundamentally quite complicated and a number of things that, That they can compare at the same time.</p><p>I believe there's only seven things that we can store in our brands at any one time. So that's my lack of comparison table because it maxes it out to the things that you can start and your brand to make a decision on purchase. so yeah, on that, we've done so much. Air B testing, heat maps, looking inside people's brains, user testing for me.</p><p>Yeah. If you're in a position to. To use a comparison any way you can. You should. it's a very cool tool. We've even used, personalization. And so we've taken their old device and pitched it against the new generation ones. So at a quick glance, they can see, Oh yeah. That's what's different.</p><p>So it's, we've really elevated that. As I said before, we went through a, you don't have to pay for maps anymore. So we elevate that. We put that in the thing. Oh, I do. I don't. I do. I don't that's in, that's not. And, yeah, fine comparison table geek, whatever you want to call it. But yeah, that's my, that's my main side.</p><p>My inside tip. If you can use comparisons and you can use personalized comparisons. Then that's even an extra level </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:56] fight. Spec offers a worldwide unique AB testing, personalization and product recommendation solution SiteSpect works service sites without any tags or scripts, which guarantees an ultimate performance.</p><p>The SiteSpect solution eliminates delays and the chance of any flickering effects. And this approach also ensures that the current and future browser stretcher rules like ATP and ADP does make an impact on your AB testing and personalization </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:20:23] for more </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:23] info visit &nbsp;dot com. Yeah. Because people, when using the device, you have to have a TomTom account.</p><p>I can imagine that, more and more people on the website, also our login. Yeah. So then if they do then you know which device they have. </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:20:38] Absolutely. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:38] So you can use that for personalization. </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:20:41] Yeah. Completely. Yeah. And then we follow them around with it. It's how personalization works.</p><p>It's yeah. Yeah, we can point out the things that they're missing out on with the new devices compared to their old devices. in some situations the devices are so old, we don't support them anymore, then that's not fit. It's not a good experience, not a good driving experience any longer.</p><p>And it is done to update and get a new one. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:05] You just mentioned the heat maps, EEG. What kind of, research methods do you guys usually use for your research? </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:21:13] it's a bit ad hoc, to be honest, it's not some sort of great roadmap plan that we have. it's just sell as much as you can. but yeah, I think a lot of it, it starts with a gut feeling and, yeah, for watching people use the website with session recordings, you can you can follow the mouse and they're actually reading things and you think, does it make sense that it's this way around?</p><p>Should it be this way around? Okay. Let's run a test and let's just flip the content and see how that works. And then obviously, yeah. even given little explanations, we can see that people were hovering over things, looking for information. All right. Let's try with, with the question about mobile, to answer what a bit more about what that feature might be.</p><p>Wow. Look at the interactions on it. People are looking for that information. Okay. Let's embellish that information. Let's see. let's make it, a far richer, let's try and explain it even better. okay. We see that this topic has got more hovers than this one. Okay. Let's put that one at the top then.</p><p>Cause that's a bit more of a question. so we'll do. Numbers of different, research is on things, but I think, yeah, a lot of it usually stops with just by session recordings. I've been spending so much time watching sessions regarding yeah, for me that's yeah. One of the, one of the killer weapons out there to find out what's going on.</p><p>And then obviously we, we do the EEG things also to get. To get an insight that you couldn't get from user testing, just per se, user testing, asking questions, because you, couldn't straight down into the subconscious and, yeah. If people are getting frustrated, looking at a table, you can see where they're looking and where the frustrated bears.</p><p>and then that's again, we turn it into a test and we rank here. We think, Is this going to really see a big shift. and then obviously if it's too complicated, but it's not, when it's a terrible, it's easy. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:01] So I don't use those EEG, research methods for the current website.</p><p>Or do you also try that out with things that's come out of, fig, to see what their reaction is before you even, pre-life </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:23:11] would be nice? no, we're not doing, for those kinds of projects just yet. it's relatively pricey. Yeah. I've saved all my money with fig it's relatively proxy. we usually yet two or three tests, just to check and we've been mainly to check in on the flow of things.</p><p>So a customer gets an email. How do they interpret that email? How does it make them feel emotionally hear negative news. then they go in and they go to the website or they'll go to my products area. And then we'll see them navigate and, follow them through the funnel. And then we make changes best on the benchmark, test that we did.</p><p>And then we'll make changes to see if we can do the improvements of where they've got most frustrated where they didn't really make sense to them. And then obviously on the points of joy, one of which, of a recent task we did, They actually enjoyed reading the text, the copy on the landing page.</p><p>It peaked in joy of, think four people out of 10 sauce. Ooh. that's really, that's something even, you know, a bit of copy can convince some joy to a sat nav buyer's life. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:17] So was it really informative or was it the funny text or? </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:24:21] as you've been talking, I'm quite hands on person and, yeah, to cut a long story short as always been at home and we need to make things a bit more personal.</p><p>We've turned the webpage where it's got my face on it. Now, Dave from Samsung wants to sell the device. So it's yeah, we want it to humanize it, how can we do that in this day and age? I can't go to the office. We can't do these kinds of things. W I set up the photography myself and, I've done product shots.</p><p>I've been super busy. and then I wrote the text from my heart, like death here at sometime. Thanks for visiting the bedroom. Really appreciate your time. I, just be honest, and yeah, the feedback here and that it really does work, so yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:03] Yeah. So one of the things, so you've been improving a lot of, things lately, because you're suddenly had a bit more time to improve the basics. I'm assuming that COVID might stick around for a bit. are there other things on your backlog that you said, Oh, that will be really nice to fix, to improve the overall process before we.</p><p>Get back to, the daily grind of zero. </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:25:26] for me, I think we've got it set up very well. We're quite mature now as a team and something that I think is quite often overlooked is spreading the culture of CRR because it's great that three people do it in a team, in a company of how many people. But if everyone's doing CRO other CRO involved in many aspects of that company, then your train is going to go way faster.</p><p>You'll learn so much more about your customers. yeah, for me, the focus is now to try and help people develop their own CRO skills. There are methods of validation, the content that they're making, that they're creating. How can you validate it? How can you know that this boss does better than this one?</p><p>This email's gonna work. If you've never asked anyone outside your circle. So I introduced, some areas of the company to things like what's that tool called now. A usability hub where you've got five, second tests. So people could just, did you understand that the offer, what was it about? So you can get a little bit of feedback, some quality feedback, enough time at all, from someone that's not in your circle.</p><p>And I find that, that's something that I'm going to help to get the rest of the company. Not all of it, cause it's massive, but where I can help to, show how to validate things. Then, for me, that's really optimization on a company culture. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:26:52] I recently had a session, for digital elite day.</p><p>and it was about, how to become better as hero practitioner. would you have any tips for heroes or just share your story? How would you, how do you go about improving your own knowledge level of thoughts? Euro, if you come across something and you say, Hey, I want to know more about that.</p><p>What do you do? Do you read a book? Do you go get a course? Do you get your hands dirty? How do you approach that? </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:27:18] I'm very much a hands on person. And, I think from everything that we pretty much mainly learn is by doing, I'm going to borrow the phrase from growth track, get shit done. That's really what it is.</p><p>Get your hands in there. See what's happened in ask customers, ask people, does this work, does that work for you? Validate things, test them out when and wherever you can. and it, yeah, if you feel compelled to go off and read about a website, ecology to do I'd say follow up. What excites you?</p><p>what, what you love about it? what area particularly excites you and then really just dive into it and learn as much as you can from wherever. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:02] And if you want to know anything about the comparison tables, go to Dave.</p><p>and for example, a two like fake model that you just, don't write in and started using it, or did you follow a course for it or whatever video tutorials that helped you out? </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:28:18] I've done a few video tutorials and I'm also one for looking for sauce fails. So if there's an issue that I don't know how to solve, there's a great community out there, So how do you do radio buttons? How do you do drop downs yet? There's a sauce file out that go look at it. Understand how it works, steal it and use it. You know what I mean? That's what it's there for. So </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:40] it's like templates. </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:28:41] Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:43] then thank you so much for sharing your story with us.</p><p>So my final question for you will be, who I should invite next as a guest on the Shiro cafe and, what I should ask him or her, </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:28:54] I believe you've done, A podcast with Roderick from Brad engineers, but I would like to invite LTL fond of fear, she's a wonderful presenter. And, she's helped us out a no end with the EEG, tests from brand engineers.</p><p>Yeah, I think you should invite her on and, and have a look at inside people's brands and, what she can tell you about the difference between a conventional user testing and, EEG testing. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:21] Yeah. And they also have this new tool. Are you guys using that too, or? </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:29:23] No, we're not using that one at the moment.</p><p>No. yes. COVID budget cuts. Let's say. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:32] So we'll ask her I'll do you know about, about brain peak and, the current status of that one? I think I spoke to Rohrig just before they released that. so yeah, it will be interesting to get an update from them. how does, how that's going? </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:29:44] I've really enjoyed working with them.</p><p>We've worked with them for a number of years now and, it's one of those things I think is always got to put a stake in the ground. And see how people are experiencing it on a subconscious level. Which yeah. Is always fascinating. Yeah, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:58] exactly. Dave, thank you so much. Great talking to you and hope to talk to you soon, somewhere offline.</p><p>Dave Powell: [00:30:05] Pleasure. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Take care. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:10] And this </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:30:10] concludes </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:10] season two, episode 41 of this year, both guys to with Dave . And again, make sure that they're shared this with your colleagues, if you like the content. And especially if you've experienced a similar market shift because of the pandemic. Next Monday, in our episode, we stay on the client side.</p><p>When I talk with Emily Oliver, UX and experimentation manager at music, magpie and declutter, and she is going to share some interesting experimentation results </p><p>Dave Powell: [00:30:37] with us. Talk to you then, and always be optimizing.</p><p>‍</p>",,3a681b62

Well, it's been a long journey for me. Actually. I started as a digital marketer, doing, SEO, AdWords management and, actually building and managing websites. And I obviously become aware of, analytics very, very early and the utility of it.</p><p>And so in the course of my career, I actually transitioned more into this data analyst role over time. But I didn't have like much training in statistical analysis of data of any kind. So I was soon hitting limitations where I will be looking at data and not being sure of how to interpret it. I would so many times forget some trend or some high level change in let's say bounce rate or number of visits from some traffic source.</p><p>That would be like, okay, but how do I know this is not like part of the usual of the data that I see on a daily or weekly basis. And even if it isn't part of that, how do I attribute Kohl's to that? How far that connected to underlying causes and that's been a major, right. Well, for me to actually start exploring, exploring statistics, design of experiments and all that.</p><p>Just the desire to be able to connect causes sweaty facts or the vice versa. If, if at all possible, </p><p>Guido: [00:02:35] I think a lot of people recognize those, those challenges that you have, but I don't think a lot of people like you dive into this sticks. like naturally dive into that, like you did. So w what would make you think, okay, let's, let's, let's just do this.</p><p>Let's, let's, let's become the expert, and, and online, and addiction statistic. </p><p>Georgi: [00:02:54] Well, for me, it wasn't much of a choice. I mean, once you really look into the details of what can you get out of coral, just observational data. And then when you understand the power of just to rank an experiment, And it is just nowhere near, I mean, it's just a necessity to run an experiment.</p><p>If you really need the causal link. And so it's just a non question for me. If you really need solid understanding of what's happening, then you're unexplained moments. Then you'll need to know the stats behind that because, otherwise you would be running experiments, but then the results won't be speaking to your words, they could, I mean, you all will be fooled by randomness as, you know, one book title girls, quite often, even with experiments.</p><p>Guido: [00:03:43] Yeah, so, and, and like 15, 20 years ago, we needed to run experiments by ourselves or run statistical models on that by ourselves and, and check all the, variables, and said those are shells, but nowadays we have a, a range of AB testing tools and those tools neatly tell us, this is the winner, this is the loser.</p><p>so. A lot of people starting out in this field might assume, okay, this is the winner, there's a loser period. So why do you think it's still important to have a statistical knowledge about what's happening? If those tools just tell us. What's happening anyway, </p><p>Georgi: [00:04:20] right? Yeah. I mean, we're really blessed.</p><p>Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's a complex question, but I'll try to answer it succinctly. So we're really blessed in your online marketing field and a usability field because we really have these awesome tools and. Or while the browsers are still, you know, allowing some kind of tracking to go through. we, we do have amazing abilities to measure so many metrics for pretty much all of our, I watch that traffic and that's obviously a huge advantage with F over, let's say scientists and psychologists, consumer behavior, or even some of the hard disciplines like physics.</p><p>And that's all great, but unless you understand the rationale behind the statistical models and the, th th the design, the design parameters of the experiments that you're running, it's going to be very hard for you to make sense of what you see. And in particular, it's going to be very hard to design efficient tests, because most of the tools out there, and I mean, Even going on, go out to Malaysia and say, Oh, of the two South, they are, none of them are pretty much, give you.</p><p>The parameters that you need to design efficient tests, any it's the mystics and the experiments. It's all about efficient use of data, but how do you define efficiency? That's the problem, right. People face and they start off stuff to wander, to ask questions like, okay, how long should I run this test for what?</p><p>Shouldn't my level of uncertainty be? What's what's the acceptable and certainty of the result from this experiment. And, you know, these happen. Two basic questions, but then there are really wants to suggest, should I run just one variant versus a control or should I run 10 versus a control just to you don't have a better chance of finding out what works best or, you know, should I be looking at the data on a daily basis on a weekly basis?</p><p>Or should I just start and then examine the DNA? And the question just by work wants to start digging into, into it. And we doubt understanding the, the. Reasoning behind the stats, you really will be, subject to this one. you know, One solution fits all problems approach, which really doesn't work. So for example, if we, if you're a startup and you're testing something, which is probably going to be live on your website for six to 12 months, does it really make sense to around with these standards of floods?</p><p>Let's say 95 from 99% significance and maybe very high power for a very small effect size. And that test that takes, let's say three or four months, or maybe even six months to run with these parameters. It doesn't really make sense to do that. And at the same time you feel are a big company funny, with like a very, very well established processes, very well established products.</p><p>It doesn't really make sense to run with these parameters either because for many tests you would actually need much higher levels of certainty before you can act. and. Yeah. That's, that's something that people easily fall into what you've done if they don't understand the reasoning behind. So they would fall into these, Black box solutions, which are really just one size fits all.</p><p>Yeah. You know, even within a company or the, in a company unit or over time, each test will be different. Each test would, require different parameters to make the most efficient way of getting to a decision. And, and unless you understand the reasoning behind, behind it, You know, the two will always recommend the same thing over and over, back at the moment to give you an example, I'm running a series of failure tests with Google optimize and I mean, the first 15 tests stopped within 32 days of a running dose.</p><p>So if I'm like the startup looking to make an agile change, I will be waiting for over a month without any kind of decision. And I'm actually planning to let the rest of the test run for whatever, however long they take, just to see, okay, how long would it take Google optimize to stop this test? Because it becomes ridiculous at some point like it unnecessarily long, and that's a product of their imposing their standards on every single test around their platform.</p><p>and that's that not, I'm not singling out Google optimize here. That's something that many other tools do. And even the ones that they, that give you some opportunity to alter these parameters. If you don't know what you're doing, how are we going to alter them in any form or manner? You're just going to be like a blind man, trying to feel their way around to try on there at that time.</p><p>That's conflict for him. Yesterday's brainstorm was so good. I really liked step's idea of running that test on the call to action buttons, making them orange will really make them stand out. Don't you think? </p><p>Guido: [00:09:14] Yeah. Right. Do you want to design real AB test winners and achieve enormous conversion of lifts, then stop, brainstorming and take a scientific approach.</p><p>If you can read Dutch, follow the steps, then online influence the bestseller on the menu, even book Delta now and rule in the authors course and become an expert in applying proven behavioral signs yourself. Go to &nbsp;dot com for more information and free downloads. When doing this when running experiments inherently there's there's There are, there are a non things.</p><p>We, we, accept a certain risk that we make a wrong decision. and while managers have rules of proteins or digital marketing themes, they just want answers. It just wants certainty that something will work or doesn't work. So how would you respond to that? </p><p>Georgi: [00:10:04] Well, I would say there is a always cost, always a trade off associated with certainty.</p><p>And for example, statistical significance are requiring higher levels of certainty there limits your post test risks. So after you implement, let's say you have a winner and you implement, but it's significantly increases the duration of the test. And so it increases the risks during testing. So if you are actually.</p><p>What you're testing is actually worse than your control. We are incumbent solution. Then you're going to be incurring these costs over the duration of the test, and then they in a similar manner, let's say, are requiring the higher statistical power. So that's a higher probability to detect actual effects.</p><p>Ah, that's also going to have. you know, this limiting effect on your gains. So, testing that basically require you to test for longer just like increasing statistical significance would, and, you know, if what you're testing is actually better than the control, that's a longer time period in which you're not reaping the benefits from that improved solution.</p><p>So that these trade offs, they need to be explained to marketers. They need to be explained to higher ups. And I think more, most people have an intuitive understanding of that, which, you know, might be misleading in some cases, but with a little bit of examples, with a little bit of work that can be overcome, I think.</p><p>A one to do that are AHS. I think it's great to just run a couple of air tests and maybe not even tell them your colleagues, that these are ETAs. Just say, yeah, we're running these two or three AB tests here. That's thinks ideas for X thing. And then, you know, you can just present them the results and say, okay, what would you like to implement based on these data?</p><p>And, when they say yes or no, and then you can say, well, that's actually an air test, so there's nothing to implement. And, you know, situations like that, obviously it's a little bit hard to replicate that. but I think even just looking at the data and, About how it changes over time will help people get this intuitive understanding of the variability, which is not, not so.</p><p>And that's what we need for us simply because most times, like we, we live in a world with fixed, properties. So if I drop my phone, the ground is going to fall like 100% of the time. so, you know, we are not used to dealing with in probabilities, but that's something that needs to be explained. So </p><p>Guido: [00:12:36] yeah, you mentioned, some people have a, an, an, an innate sense of this and intuition of, of how this works.</p><p>which might not actually, be true when we talk about the AB test, but do you think we can each teams or, or the managers of those teams, there's experimentation mindset? Is, is that teachable or is it, is it all the way through? </p><p>Georgi: [00:12:58] I definitely think it's teachable. as I mentioned, AA tests, that's one way to do it.</p><p>Another is to just examine cases where they didn't experiment, where they just went and went on with it and implemented. And then, they had, horrible consequences. And that happens, I think, often enough that you'll have plenty of opportunities to do that. I've actually shared plants, such example from our own website and just the other day, which had one other, such like a disaster where we lost a lot of money because, we were too quick to implement, based on, I'm going to say it's related to, access policy compliance and we were just, okay.</p><p>Yeah. Well, we will have to implement this. we need to be compliant. Bullshit life, you know, there's no, no point of discussion here. And the ones later on, we can get the data. And I think, it's our decline is due to, the virus epidemic situation. But no, it's just our own stupidity. So that's put in briefly.</p><p>Guido: [00:14:03] So basically what you're saying is let them make mistakes. That's the best learning. they can probably have. </p><p>Georgi: [00:14:08] I think we will be there. Just take things apart. You need to explain how these mistakes could have been prevented with a variation, high probability. If there were tests in place, if there were procedures to test every decision.</p><p>And, I think that that's, that's something that people don't really understand when they go into testing most of the time, unless they should. They know the statistical side of things they're doing that. They're testing ideas. But the truth is they're not there. I think particular implementations of ideas.</p><p>And even if the idea is great, the implementation could be broken or could be suboptimal and might have no effect or even a negative effect. And sometimes even a bad the idea, like a bad reasoning for why you're doing something might lead to a really great user experience, which actually improve sales for reasons other than the ones that you initially went with.</p><p>So I think, Yeah. And ms. Facer and good opportunity to explain how that, that's my same vein. </p><p>Guido: [00:15:06] Now that's a good point. You, you, you need a proper hypothesis and you probably need multiple experiments to test to validate that hypothesis rises not, not one experiment. And then, you can fellow date, your RD.</p><p>You already know certain or, That your ID is working yes or no. Now it might be that particular implementation that you just happen to use and not necessarily validate that exact ID. </p><p>Georgi: [00:15:31] Exactly. So, for example, would you have a background in psychology? You might have like a certain idea of how consumer behavior might be influenced or, assisted in a positive manner.</p><p>And, you know, you can come up with a one test, two, one, one implementation, one, A way of changing your website or your checkout experience or whatever to test that, but maybe you've overlooked some other factor they are. So if you're really testing the idea of, this psychological mechanism will help us, then you will definitely need a bunch of tests to try and get the different stages of the website, maybe triangulate with different messaging with different visuals.</p><p>just because sometimes it's it's, the implementation. Which is more important than the idea. It has a swamping effect on the actual, you know, there might be underlying through effects and then there might be a negative effect from the implementation. So, yeah, and also sometimes, I mean, Dustin dos are not perfect or sometimes there would be issues with the that's the set up itself.</p><p>So even, even the ideas ago, even if the implementation is good, the best is poorly set up. For whatever reason, there are some measurement issues. And you still get biased results, meaning that they don't reflect the underlying reality. </p><p>Guido: [00:16:49] Yeah, exactly. and so you worked with, several companies doing this.</p><p>Do you see certain companies or verticals or, or people being exceptionally good at this, or way worse at doing this, accepting this mindset? </p><p>Georgi: [00:17:06] Yeah, I would say so. I think. Kind of naturally digital companies or data driven companies like businesses, which are data driven by by day by day or core are much quicker to, get on the AB testing train simply because they've had a lot of experience with, observational data and they are keenly aware of the dangers of over interpreting what the data says and, They are very quick to recognize, okay.</p><p>If we can run a test, a natural controlled experiment, that's going to be much, much better than just looking at some they can analytics, let's say. so yeah, I think these companies that traditionally have used data or where data is their core business, they are very quick to come to grasp. and then on the other side, I think it's, It's the commerce eCommerce companies then lead gen companies and then publishers and like, yeah, but we should in general, that's the scale.</p><p>I'll put it in. simply because </p><p>Guido: [00:18:09] that's, that's like an, like an order </p><p>Georgi: [00:18:11] in way most proficient and most quick toward the uptake. It testings to least simply because, I think it's partly, I think if. Having the data, the ability to measure or eCommerce websites, it's very </p><p>Guido: [00:18:26] version point is completely online, right?</p><p>so the, the closer your conversion is, and if it's completely online, the easier it is to adopt that </p><p>Georgi: [00:18:33] that gets much easier to come up with metrics, that are both measurable and actionable and speak to the business. bottom line. Whereas for publishers, it's much harder because for example, let's say you're optimizing for pixel rate of a title.</p><p>Well, on some level, yes, &nbsp;is always better, but there are situations where that's not necessarily the case. And, sometimes, you know, there are, let's say, let's say that your most &nbsp;content actually, Draws in the lift, advertisers. So the lowest quality, so they will have the lowest bid therefore for their arts.</p><p>And so you might be increasing your number of impressions by let's say two fold, but at the same time, that decreases your average revenue per million by, By some by some, but for me it was I'm sorry, by some margin, then you might actually be losing money by, by increasing your impressions. So there, there are these difficulties that I think are part of the reason why such companies are usually slower to adapt or data driven.</p><p>Guido: [00:19:35] SiteSpect offers a worldwide unique AB testing, personalization and product recommendation solution. Sites paperworks service sites without any tags or scripts, which guarantees an optimal performance, the SiteSpect solution eliminates delays and the chance of any flickering effects. And this approach also ensures that the current and future brows through rules like ITP and ETP, don't make an impact on your AB testing and personalization for more info visit &nbsp;dot com.</p><p>He also see, a difference in this, this kind of risk management management between, established businesses and start. Sure, </p><p>Georgi: [00:20:14] sure. Yeah. And I'm adding this, this speaks to my previous point about one size fits all solutions. And so. Let's say you're a startup or you're a much more agile than a well established, mature business with thousands of employees, let's say.</p><p>And you can turn on, turn on a dime. you're happy to, to implement high risk solutions simply because, you know, even if it doesn't work, you can just pivot and, Obviously the testing environment, there would be much more agile, much more, you know, the, maybe the risk of missing a true effect would be even, of higher priority than the risk of breaking something, you know, especially in those very early stages, whereas for a mature company, the equation usually goes the other way.</p><p>And also another major difference is the period during which whatever you do will persist so forth. The fact of the year, you might have a horizon of six months, 12 months, even we are, but that's, that's rare. So what you do now now will stay and have an effect for let's say any year, but for 'em. You know, mature company, somethings that you do might be there for 10 years or 15 years.</p><p>Seven, let's say, I mean, a software from the Microsoft office here. I mean, how many drastic changes do you see there over the past 10 years? Not that many. Right. And so the stakes are higher. And, so the risk is it's large there, and I think that's, that's one of the major differences </p><p>Guido: [00:21:49] new, you also see a difference, or maybe do you think there should be a difference in the, in the objectives, of, of how those companies run experiments between for example, startups and more established businesses </p><p>Georgi: [00:22:01] objectives?</p><p>I'm not sure, not sure about objectives. I think. On the business side, they should be most of the stuff. I think &nbsp;of the life of a startup. You start measuring different things and caring about different things. Let's say if initially you're all about the position. At one point, you need to transition to retain the existing you as advisors, existing clients.</p><p>And that's maybe one of the biggest changes that happens. And it brings with it a whole lot of new metrics and new types of experiments to run. I think other than that, not the objectives should be fairly, fairly same similar. </p><p>Guido: [00:22:43] Okay. And, and for, for our startups, I can imagine, like you said earlier, some, sometimes it might be as a startup.</p><p>You don't have a lot of data, maybe not enough data to, to run the experiments you want to run. maybe you do. And then sometimes you say, okay, but we're. Maybe previous, like offline research already told you something and you're going to implement something. Anyway. Would you still advise companies then to run a beta test or run an experiment to validate that or if you're going to implement it anyway?</p><p>Georgi: [00:23:12] Yes. Sure. Because, just the simple fact that the given approach works for others doesn't mean that it will work for you and for them, or even if it works, speaking to our previous, what we previously covered. Your implementation might be faulty or might be significantly different, even if you don't think it is.</p><p>So it might be a simple layout thing or simple cower thing or simple wording. Difference that actually, it was what, what made it work for those like 10 other companies and you're taking their experience, but it's not necessarily the experience. And I mean, I think you know that from psychology experiments where.</p><p>Context is a highly, you know, the, some of them are highly sensitive to context. And so our results, we want to replicate under mild variations of the context that don't have to be substantial to have substantial effects. </p><p>Guido: [00:24:06] Yeah. I literally, I had a company they wanted, so they were working on a new design of their website and they, as an example, they were a big fan of, one of the larger, Our clothing companies in the Netherlands, I'm doing this online, but they were selling bicycles.</p><p>Okay. </p><p>Georgi: [00:24:25] Well, </p><p>Guido: [00:24:26] that's it. There's there's a there's. I expect there to be a difference in how people purchase, like, $20 t-shirts or $2,000, bicycles. </p><p>Georgi: [00:24:37] Exactly. And also there is the difference between the, consumer oriented versus business to business projects. So for example, one test we did was informed by, okay, can we be more aggressive with our, But it's just a button, the wording, and it turns out we can only go so much because we're a, B to B and it just doesn't really make sense to be aggressive as you will be with some like really, like spur of the moment purchase types of, items.</p><p>So, </p><p>Guido: [00:25:07] yeah, you just mentioned that, that there's a difference between, how companies are suited to, to run experiments. And, we kind of established that the closer to the metric is your, your business metric is to what you can actually measure the better it is for you. So for e-commerce the purchase is online.</p><p>That's something you can measure within your analytics. so that's, that's, that's a positive thing, for, more like news websites. Those metrics are more longterm, or, or even offline. Ah, so it's harder to measure. So you have, metrics, that's tried to indicate a positive, behavior, like click through rate on the, on a title.</p><p>like you mentioned, but I mean, you don't know, surely want people to click on your title. You want them to read the article to click on the advertisements and so on. but also even for, for eCommerce, just one purchase might not be the optimal way to optimize, or the optimal metric to optimize for.</p><p>So how do you advise companies to, to pick their, the metric that they're actually using software e-commerce for me, it sounds logical to more look at like Lorelei, like lifetime value. If they even know what their lifetime value is from it, for their customers. so there's, there's a wide range of what you can pick as a, as a metric.</p><p>The ultimate four can be click through rate, very simple, very straightforward, Donny, a lot of traffic for that on the other ends. And the other end of the spectrum can be lifetime value. but it might take a very long time to run the experiments. Even if I have this, metrics, some companies don't even have that.</p><p>so what, what is, what's your advice for companies on, on picking a metric? </p><p>Georgi: [00:26:47] I'm a first piece of advice would be to not be, to not be going for convenience. So most of the literature, most of the examples out there, most of the 2000, there are pretty happy to help your calculate compression rates and to run tests based on conversion rate as a primary, My measurement </p><p>Guido: [00:27:06] as like the name of our industry.</p><p>Right? </p><p>Georgi: [00:27:09] Exactly. And that's also the metric which clients would be most comfortable with. You know, they will be familiar with it. so convenience and that's something you should avoid. And the reason is, as you said, you know, the clothes, the metric is to your business. Bottom line, the easier it is to interpret it into okay.</p><p>Doing, do we actually want to make this decision? Or, do we actually need more data to do it? And we come to the dreaded trade off key word here. So it's a trade off. If you will go by conversion rates, you will know something about the rate at which users purchase, but you won't be missing information of how many items did they purchase, what these items are worth.</p><p>And then if you have some kind of, as, as you mentioned, lifetime value model, what's the, No, probably like lifetime value of those, new customers that say they're new and, yeah, with conversion rates, you can go quicker, but you have. less information to act on. So it's actually, the, the, the trade off is pretty, pretty much.</p><p>it's a constant thing. There is no shortcuts. That's something I've been trying to instill in my readers for a long time that, yeah, there, if it looks too good to be true, it's too good to be true. If it says that you can run the test in two weeks instead of, two months, Probably trading off something somewhere.</p><p>And if you don't understand what it is, you're in danger, because then you might be making decisions based on information, which doesn't really mean what you think it means. And that couldn't be worse than not doing experiments at all in some cases simply because you will make the change, you think, yeah, it's solid or we've tested it.</p><p>It works. And then if your observational data following the implementation says, otherwise you will be much less inclined to question that decision because I mean, that's it right? So it's has to be something else. </p><p>Guido: [00:29:04] Marketing budgets have suffered. And the sheriff for AB testing has been impacted too. If you want to keep that thing to enterprise standards, but save 80% on your annual contract, you can consider it.</p><p>But there's some release you can take advantage of full stack and hybrid features, strong privacy compliance, no </p><p>Georgi: [00:29:23] blink and enterprise. </p><p>Guido: [00:29:26] Great security. Feel good about your smart business decision infest, what you saved? Becking your CRO program. Check out the www adults. &nbsp;2020. Am I right to assume that, if you don't have a lot of data, like with most, most startups, you, you, you look at the trade off is okay, well, let's, go for it.</p><p>The easier things or the things that we can at least, test for. We can, we can validate for load level. Maybe, we need to optimize for click through rate. And then the more mature you get, the more data you get as a company, the further away, the metric is, in your business life cycle that you, that that's the one you pick, to optimize for each, or you go from, conversion rates, off, off of click through rates.</p><p>So conversion rates for maybe your newsletter to conversion rate of, actual orders through actual lifetime value. Is that, is that a right? A simple, </p><p>Georgi: [00:30:23] no, I would actually not recommend that. Sorry to disappoint, but yeah, I, I, my, my understanding is that you should use the best metric that you have available, but you should alter your expectation about the uncertainty with which you would need to act.</p><p>So if the metric is a, If you can measure average order value or sorry, average revenue per user, then yeah. It's. If it takes your life three months to get to 95% significance. Dan. Yeah, you can see, okay. We're three months is way too long. It doesn't make sense for us to test for that long. Yeah, we should test from just two months, but we will be happy to accept.</p><p>Let's say 90%, a significant stress cold as a decision, you know, first score and I think that's the more. The more honest approach, if you will, because this way you're still measuring what you really want to measure. And that's question number one, and only in the second place, do you start specify the design of the experiment?</p><p>Which includes things like the statistical significance, the power, I mean, will affect the trust and all that. So. First you should be measuring what really matters to the business. What is easy to interpret without, without doubts, because let's say you achieve an improvement in conversion rate. Well, is it because, is it actually a positive for the business you can't really say, unless you also look at average order value and, Who asked you to do that?</p><p>You're actually looking at the average revenue per user, which is just the product of the two. And so what are we doing here? Like you're you're if you do that, you're likely, lying to yourself </p><p>Guido: [00:31:58] till you're saying, yeah, you shouldn't, you shouldn't make concessions on the metric. The metric should be, should be pretty much the same throughout your lifecycle of the company.</p><p>That that should be. A fixed thing and that the best thing you can measure and that connects with your, with your business goals. but, but do, do those concessions on a confidence level or, significance? </p><p>Georgi: [00:32:21] Yeah, exactly. I mean, I think this way it's easier for everyone involved, festers, usability experts, hierarchs to understand what's actually going on because otherwise, if they're smart, they're, they're going to start asking these questions.</p><p>Okay. Conversion rate is up, but what about Valor, Charlotte? What about, you know, our revenue? At the end and inevitably your results will be interpreted as if they pertain to the business metric, which are your higher ups care about. And believe me, most of them are not measured by a commercial rate to their immersion by the money in the bank and insult yeah.</p><p>The closer it can be the, to that the better, </p><p>Guido: [00:33:00] and can also be different for different business units or different countries that you're in depending on the situation. Right. Or depending on the strategy of the company. I, I once worked for a company selling flowers online, and in some companies, sort of sorry.</p><p>So in some countries they were the market leader. So then you want to ultimize for profit. you're already the market leader, so that's fine. You don't necessarily want to, massively expand your, Your your customer base, because it's already the largest that there is. But if you're a challenger in the country and country, you might even be fine with losing money for certain, maybe you hope for the next two years, you're fine with, playing break even.</p><p>not, not making any profit at all, but is that still the business that needs to recite on those strategies? Not AB testing is not going to give you an answer on it. </p><p>Georgi: [00:33:45] Absolutely. Absolutely. And there are also businesses where let's say a time is essential, so maybe you're in the food business or something elsewhere.</p><p>If you don't sell the item, it's gone. Basically her op it's an on the loose it's valid completely. So you have different things to consider, but that should all go into the metric like that. That's the idea for Aniko Harvey's overall evaluation criteria. So it should encompass these things. Ideally it could be a composite metric.</p><p>It could be one single, you know, number, which, Combines different metrics, but yeah, the margin comes first and then you'll try to estimate it and certainty in the most cost efficient way available to you. And that's, that's where statistics. </p><p>Guido: [00:34:34] Yeah. My advice to a digital teams run when picking their metric is usually to ignore whatever the digital team is doing, but, but go over to the finance team or to CFO and ask them what they are looking for.</p><p>That's a great advice because then, then you know, what to your company and the management's actually seeing. They can, you can try optimize for that. That's great advice. So you, you mentioned, destined for two or three months. I think that's a, that's a hotly debated topic in this Euro industry. How long to run tests for, so what is your, what, what's your answer to that?</p><p>How long should I run a test? I mean, there's limited of course, to, I used to say, we can make concessions to, to the significance level. but do we also make concessions in how long we can run the test? Is there a maximum or a minimum? </p><p>Georgi: [00:35:18] These are basically the two parameters that we need to trade off against each other there's duration and a significance level.</p><p>So, We can go into all the different costs and benefits that come with the longer tests. So obviously on the cost side, if you're testing longer something which is hurting your revenue, or you're actually losing revenue during the test. And at the same time, if what you're testing is better, you are leaving money on the table.</p><p>So would say the longer you're testing. So these are the trade offs during the test duration. And then once you implement accounts exploitation, and let's say you expect from the moment you started the test, to the moment where you expect like a complete design overhaul or something like to, to change drastically for the business, let's say that's three years.</p><p>Well, if you thirst for three months, then that leaves you three, two years and, nine months to exploit whatever you find. And if you test for six months, then that leaves you just two years and six months. So that's less time to reap the benefits from, from your test. And these are the basic trade-offs one needs to have in their head.</p><p>One thinking about. It has duration. There is no hard and fast rule about that. Actually I've designed the whole, Metadata assessing what's the optimal balance between the test duration and the significant stress called, and you can actually access that as a tool on vine and you can plug in a lot of those business metrics.</p><p>and also a few statistical parameters, like let's say the historical or the baseline conversion rate that you expect. Like the usual thing you will do, the plant has statistically and with the business information provided it will, Outputs, you know, an optimal design, so an optimal in the sense that it balances the duration of the test.</p><p>We the significance that can be obtained. That is the certainty that can be obtained. And that's my solution to this problem. Yeah. It's far from perfect, but I've not seen anything close to it yet, so I hope it's going to be useful to the Suffolk. </p><p>Guido: [00:37:25] Yeah. So there's not necessarily a one size fits all answer to the question.</p><p>How long should I run a test? </p><p>Georgi: [00:37:31] I don't think anyone can. Can you give us the chance? Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:37:35] Thank you so much for, for being on the podcast. We're almost running out of time already. I think I, I feel like we could talk for another hour, at least. So you you've been working on, obviously you've written a book you've created a course at CXL you run analytics, toolkit.</p><p>What are your plans for the upcoming 12 months? What are you working on? </p><p>Georgi: [00:37:54] Actually, I mean, for the past five, six years, I've mostly been working on, okay, what are the best statistical methods that we can apply to online and the testing? How do we do it actually in practice, like, or how we overcome practical limitations?</p><p>this. Balancing between the risk and reward, like optimal risk reward calculations. That has been a major thing for me in the past several years as well. And now I think the more important work ahead for me is making sure these ideas can reach the largest base possible, making them easily digestible.</p><p>So communications improving the way I can communicate these ideas is actually going to be a major focus for me. Experiments AA tests of blog posts. And, obviously talks like, the one that we just had, I hope would help some people too. No Ella have any, if you have an easier time understanding, these quite crucial ideas.</p><p>Yeah. We'll say, </p><p>Guido: [00:38:49] and as a final question, do you have any book recommendations for our audience besides of course your own </p><p>Georgi: [00:38:55] over the past six months, the bus book, maybe just think I've read has been in, Ronnie Kohavi and, yep. D again, what's what was the third altar? I think, just watch your mind control &nbsp;is the title highly recommended a lot of good advice, a lot of practical examples from obviously around of us experience and yeah, it's a.</p><p>I think for middle level and above, like, you have to have some experience with AB testing to appreciate it. Yeah. If you do, then I think it's going to be valuable for you. </p><p>Guido: [00:39:28] Yeah. For, for those that don't know, only worked for Microsoft before and now work for Airbnb still. I think, I mean, Airbnb wasn't, they had some layoffs, but I think Ronnie is still, he's still working there and yeah, his book, we will we'll link to his book in the, in the show notes.</p><p>And I think it's available on a Kindle. I don't think it's an audio book. Yeah. It's but I think it's definitely on Kindle and of course the physical form, or you can order that it'll be in the show notes. Yogi. Thank you so much for sharing this with all of us. We'll definitely also link to your website.</p><p>Of course, in the show notes. If, if people want to learn more about you and they can reach out to you, I think online, LinkedIn, Twitter, what do you prefer if they have any questions? </p><p>Georgi: [00:40:09] LinkedIn is best and thank you for costing me with always been a pleasure and a delight to talk to you today. </p><p>Guido: [00:40:15] You're welcome.</p><p>Thanks so much.

He's also the co-author of an Amazon.com's bestselling book: ""Conversion Optimization: The Art and Science of Converting Visitors into Customers, a book he published already 10 years ago.</p><ul><li>CRO Mastery course <a href=""https://bit.ly/CroMastery"">https://bit.ly/CroMastery</a><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/khalidh_marketing-conversionoptimization-abtesting-ugcPost-6673293163072942080-wQvB"" target=""_blank"">‍</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/khalidh_marketing-conversionoptimization-abtesting-ugcPost-6673293163072942080-wQvB"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn post on ""Guaranteed results""</a></li></ul>",,,conversion-optimization,"<p>Khalid Saleh: [00:00:00] So my name is Khalid Saleh. I have been doing conversion optimization CRO since 2006, a long, long before even full knew what CRO it is.</p><p>And I still remember the early days of, because we would talk to VP of Phoebe's of eCommerce CMOs, and they would ask. So what do you guys help with? And I tell them, well, we help with conversion rate optimization. And they're like, Oh, search engine optimization. I'm like, no, it's something different. It was an interesting challenge back then because you really trying to educate people about, about CRO, how it started as a and interesting stories.</p><p>So I come from a development background. I finished my computer science degree from college. I was a software developer, senior software developer, then a software architect. So I, I saw a clear path, you know, I'm like, okay, software architect. Then my next level was going to be either a director of development or a CTO.</p><p>That was my plan altogether. In 2005, I get a dream projects. Motorola finally decided they need to have an eCommerce sites and they were willing to invest millions of dollars and it's, and I still remember getting the calls. You're going to be one of the three architects on the project, about 120 developers working, two other architects with me, price tag, $35 million, three months to spend that money, develop everything.</p><p>And it was. It was a dreamland, I mean, whatever features we wanted, they said, just go ahead and implement them. We, we implemented everything you can imagine within the span of three months. And of course, as a software, as a software architect, you get to choose what pieces of the software you work on.</p><p>So like, you know, the interesting parts you're like, I'm going to work on this and I'm going to give the rest of the team new </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:01:42] technologies. </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:01:45] That's literally what we did. That was just funny because now if I mentioned some of those technologies feel safe, really? That was new. I'm like, yes, it was 2005. It was new back then.</p><p>Long story short. We, we finally come to the Launch day, we're excited. And I remember I'm reading about marketing. I was interested in a CEO at that point at that point. And I'm convinced in my mind that they're going to have a problem when it comes to visitors, to the sites, they're not going to have enough book come to the site.</p><p>We turned the new sites on and we had 16 servers, Microsoft servers, and it's a cluster environment. And within two hours, three hours, the whole cluster goes down. All the servers are down all of our 16 beefy servers. So they did not have the problem that I imagined that they would cause there were a ton of traffic, tons of visitors because they had the advertising campaigns on billboards and online everywhere you can imagine.</p><p>Great. I'm happy. I'm not going. We can bring the service back up. We'll figure out the issue. But then another problem happened because a month later for our $35 million investment for the $35 million investment that Motorola had put in the project, they had about 10 orders, not great ROI, you know, I mean, he probably could have people money, you know, it was like here here's $200 on buy from us.</p><p>We'll be better ROI. Long story short, some people lost their jobs, and in my head a spark for a new idea, I'm like, Oh, we can, we can do something there. and that's how the idea of invest started actually. it's kind of like at the same time my wife had had her, we had our first baby and she was sitting at home and she's like, well, I don't want to go out and work.</p><p>What should I do? I'm like, well, you know, we ran into this problem. Maybe you can figure out a way to help companies solve this issue. Never imagined is going to become an agency. I'm gonna choose a completely different career path. But here I am 15 years later doing CRO loving every, every minute of it.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:03:45] Yeah. And I, jumped forward till, two, this week. I saw you post a short video on LinkedIn. and, and, and many people, listening to this podcast minds might recognize this. but the main message of the, of the video you posted is, asking his hero. If they guarantee results is a dumb question, dumb request.</p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:04:08] So please explain. Sure. So I always say, like, even on my LinkedIn profile, I have a very strong opinions. But they are weakly held so I can change my opinion if somebody convinces me otherwise. And I think by the way, that's what CRO does to you. I am constantly humbled by, by visitors and by experiments that we run, I used to give talks and I still do, around, around the world.</p><p>And I would say. This is absolutely the truth I noticed. And then we run an experiment a month later on the curly. Really? This is what one shouldn't have. so we, we get this quite a bit, many companies can't and, you know, as they go through the process, they're interested in conversion optimization because they typically have seen gay study, about an AB test that generated 2015, the a hundred, sometimes 500% uplifting conversion.</p><p>So they get through the excited. They look up the top companies and then they usually like, you know, they'll, they'll reach out to them. They say, Hey, we'd like to invest with you guys. And the next question, do you know if they have not done marketing long enough that you'll hear this question, we're going to X invest amount of dollars.</p><p>Can you guarantee the results? Yeah. And I always tell them, well, Conversion optimization. Ultimately the core at the heart of it is as the process testing, experimenting, and when you're experimenting, ultimately what you're doing is you're saying that I have a hypothesis, I've done my analysis. I've done my research.</p><p>I have a really good theory of five visitors are acting a certain way and now I can, how I can adjust that behavior. But I don't know. I want to experiment. I want to validate that hypothesis. And that's the reason we call it the experimentation. We don't call it the guaranteed results. Now I offended somebody recently because they said, well, you don't guarantee any results.</p><p>And I told them, I'm like, let me be very Frank with you. A couple of things. If anybody, whether you sign up with us or not, if anybody guarantees results, you probably should walk away from that number two. If I can guarantee results, I would have humongous list of companies standing in line, wanting to sign up with us that doesn't happen either.</p><p>I'd love for it to happen. but it's not happening and it doesn't happen with anybody. Now, what I can guarantee you is we will do the analysis. We will do lots of discovery. You will see the work, you will see the, but this is getting created, but it is up to your visitors to judge. Whether we know what we're doing or not.</p><p>so, and then the other thing that I always add the first two to three months in any CRO engagement, you have some quick wins, correct? That's like, you're like, okay. I think based on my experience, that can figure out how I can increase conversion rates, but really you're just doing research. You're just understanding.</p><p>The website visitors, you're making assumptions about them. And after about three months, you start saying, okay, you know what? Now I understand how visitors click. I understand really for this particular website, what I need to do, but before then, you're just guessing. And you're just throwing your opinion out.</p><p>Some people feel very uncomfortable with what I say, but I'm like, this is just the reality. You do it long enough. This is, this is how you should deal with it. Yeah, exactly. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:07:06] And then we are more like the R and D department of the eCommerce team writes is it's </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:07:11] not the guaranteed results. We </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:07:12] do research.</p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:07:14] It's just almost like it. Like when somebody, I always tell I'm like, you know, I, I faced two people there, a group of people that say we don't believe in AB testing. experimentation. We don't believe in that. And I always tell them like, well, you take, when you get sick, take any medicine. They're like, Oh, of course.</p><p>I'm like, I tell them, look, do you recognize that every medicine that you take before it gets put out in the market, it goes through a process of AB testing experimentation. Now at the same time, I'm asking for guaranteed results in CRO is almost like going to a company and telling them that a to scientist and tell them you have to go and see that this drug is going to work.</p><p>No, they don't know, you know, they've done the best research, but then sometimes they put a drug out and they discover that, Oh, it's making things worse. People are dying. That's the same, </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:07:56] asking a people asking for a guaranteed a COVID-19 vaccine within </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:08:03] X months. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:08:04] You don't know, maybe berries will be there.</p><p>Maybe you'll never be there. We don't know. </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:08:09] Or you can use them the malaria drugs. Correct? Exactly. Exactly. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:08:18] Yeah. And also I think it's zero, of course. I think that's an often discussed topic within people are practicing zero to zero is not the best term. Or what we do. Right. And that's, I think part of the issue, I guess, when, when, people outside of our field, see what we do and see, okay.</p><p>Conversion rate optimization. Okay. Tell me how much can you optimize my conversion rates? </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:08:40] I mean, it's, it's. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:08:41] It's not necessarily a dumb, but </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:08:45] yeah, I just, I just had to use that term just to get people to talk. It's a tough one because, and I've seen some posts online about people saying, well, we should call it something else.</p><p>And I see, for example, that the optimize the core cause of the experimentation, I have. Mixed feelings about that, because I remember doing CRO before. I remember when the term first came out, the Eisenberg's Brian Eisenberg came up with the term and then they start using it, the future now, which is it, which doesn't exist at this point.</p><p>But it's almost like you're fighting a losing battle and I'm like, Oh, it is what it is. But really the problem is in understanding what people like, you know, the, the understand that people have about CRO and what it entails. And it's understanding what Sarah practitioner, practitioners themselves understand about the field and how they optimize and how they can increase conversions.</p><p>Conversion rate itself is difficult to optimize sometimes. Correct. So, yeah. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:09:40] Yeah. And also the, the, the, the challenge with the term experimentation I find is that businesses are not. Interested in experimenting there, they're interested in the results, which might be increasing the conversion rates, which is why that terminology works.</p><p>But they're not necessarily interested in the next permutation. If you say, Oh, I want to experiment on your website. That's okay. Sure. But I'm only going to pay for that. </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:10:03] You know, I think you hit the nail on its head because. Lots of times. And this is by the way, one of the challenges with doing CRO, we focus the success rate for conversion optimization testing programs.</p><p>It hovers around anywhere 10 to 12 to 15%. People are usually Brown proud when they get to 15%. And I always saw them like, you know, in the industry, we focused a lot about what we learned. We're learning from failed experiments. We're learning. And I completely appreciate that. Then that's what we do. But I want to think of it from the other side of the table, from the side of the CMO or the business owner or the founders of the startup, they're really not interested in what we're learning.</p><p>We eventually earned the right to talk about those failures. Correct. But initially they're like, Oh, I'm not paying for science over here. I'm paying for results. I want to see exactly what impact you have on my bottom line while we learned this and this, and this is about your customer. Well, how do I translate that into dollars in the bank?</p><p>Because that's ultimately what my investors want to know. And that's what I want to know. Yeah. That's kind of like the field where we struggle, a CRS marketing majors have suffered. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:11:05] And the sheriff for AB testing has been impacted too. If you want to keep that thing to enterprise standards, but safe, 80% on your annual contract, you can consider a comfort, but there's summer release.</p><p>You can take advantage of full stack and hybrid features, strong </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:11:21] privacy compliance, no blink and enterprise. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:11:25] Great security. Feel good about your smart business position. Infested what you saved, backing your CRO program. Check out www dot &nbsp;</p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:11:35] dot com </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:11:36] slash 2020 walking about experimentation and maybe even our R and D.</p><p>chiro is often, applied as optimizing what we already have. how do you think's hero's canal in, in discovering new features? </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:11:54] I think this is such a, an important question. Lots of times when we do CRO, there's different levels that you work on. So at the very basic, very basic level, you know, you have bugs on the website, you have performance issues, you have the ability issues as mobile first or not.</p><p>You gotta get that out of the way. And that's simple in all honesty, some of that stuff is not, does not even require a CRO, correct. A good QA company, quality assurance company should be able to point out to you the bugs that you have on your website, right. They don't exactly which, you know, keeps us in business and, and you can use analytics and you can use heat maps and session replays.</p><p>And. Yeah to find some of those issues. So that's, that's fine. And that's the very first level. The next level is what I call usability issues. And I always also like to make the distinction between usability and conversion. I think both impact the website, conversion rates and both impact revenue, but usability.</p><p>I think of it as more top of mind issues. I'm clicking on a button as a user and I expect certain things to happen, but they're not happening. you know, I'm trying to do certain things on your website then, you know, the system is not responding to me. Less fixed usability issues. Now the level above that is conversion.</p><p>And when I go to conversion, I'm working on two things. One is issues that you have on the website. So persuasiveness, how does your website convince me to buy? So that's number one. Number two is new features that you must have. And lots of times we ignore those, but those are so powerful because you go out from.</p><p>I'm tweaking the website and I'm enhancing certain things into, guess what? I've just opened, like, you know, a whole new revenue stream for you a lot more strategic. I'll give you a couple of examples first on the usability versus CRO. cause people always look at like really, and I know this has been a debate that's been going on for a while.</p><p>I was telling you on the, whenever you fix usability issues on a, on a website, you end up with a website where. The visitors thinking to themselves can buy from this website. You it's conversion issues. There's two levels. When it comes to fixing conversion issues. The first one is you go from, I can buy from this website and two, I want to buy from this website.</p><p>Very powerful. You fix persuasiveness issues. The second level of conversion you go into, I must buy from this website or conversion and you go from the 1% to 2% to eight or 10%. So that's, that's one example. The other example about strategic initiatives. So I have a friend who does lots of user research and it's funny because he would never call what he does conversion optimization, but really that's what he does.</p><p>Like, you know, at some level, right. And he was working with a, re a manufacturer for furniture you'll figure. I was like, okay. And he's doing customer research for them. They sell, bedroom sets and he's interviewing all those users. And he discovered that. Typically in the past, when people bought bedroom sets, they, you know, they put it in their bedroom and they sleep.</p><p>And that's the end of that. But now there's the transformation, especially with COVID the bedroom sets, especially on Saturday day and Sunday hums hangout place for the, for the whole family. We're not long, we're no longer just using the bedrooms, that's asleep and it looks nice. No, we actually want the bedroom set for the kids to hang out.</p><p>So the bedroom functionality needs to change. And I was talking to him. I'm like, he's like, this is so powerful because now he's working with that Spanish factor to say, so how do we rethink manufacturing? The bedroom sets no longer is just a bench, you know? And I had dressed and all that and I'm like, okay, this is powerful user research.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:15:18] Turn it into a workplace or a play area. </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:15:22] It's so powerful. Correct. And now, instead of like, Oh, I'm just tweaking the website and making it more user friendly. I opened a new line of business and we're talking about $80 million of additional revenue per day, then 2021. That's powerful. That's conversion optimization.</p><p>That's Beth. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:15:39] Oh, you help, companies find, basically the broken areas on the websites, whether it's usability or preservation. I think that mainly, it sounds mainly like the BJ fork model, right? So you need to increase, both, your usability and your perspiration and you need prompts to have people act.</p><p>On the website. It doesn't make sense to have really persuasive websites if it's been usable and the other way around, it can be very user friendly, but if no one wants to buy there, it's not use. But how do you go about helping people find those broken areas on their website? How do you find out what is broken?</p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:16:13] There are many models that we use. And I think like now it became a standard, a standard model for lots of CRO. So one of the things that we'll do whenever a new client comes on board, there is. A whole bunch of interviews that we conducted when it comes to user research and we use the jobs to be done framework.</p><p>Yeah. That helps us really drill very deep to understand what bill wants to buy. What are they using the products for? What did they decide to stop using his instead one day bought this new product and that's built the foundation for any conversion optimization work that we do now next after that, we'll do.</p><p>a series of activities, we'll do an expert review if they want, we're doing an expert review, we're getting two, three of our team members sitting in a room, looking at the website from the perspective of the visitor and looking at usability issues and conversion issues, looking at the mobile and desktop we're looking at.</p><p>Okay. So where we're coming from, which landing page what's the keyword that they're using. So making sure that there's continuity. So we typically run the site through 150 different points. Just jotting down all those different issues that we see on the West side. after that we'll look at analytics.</p><p>So now we look at data and try and figure out using the data. What's the story that we're seeing on the website and data is extremely powerful. Yes. This can be tricky, correct? Because if you look at data long enough, it can tell you whatever story he wants to hear. So you have to be very careful. we're looking at heat maps, video gear, recording, session replays, of users, users on the, on the site.</p><p>We conduct user research, but on a smaller scale compared to the user research that we do. And that's when you see those popups that appear on the website, trying to understand yeah. Three different types of elements. I would say motivators, what's bringing people to the website and we tried to understand barriers.</p><p>What's stopping people from converting and hooks for those who converted, what actually persuaded you to convert. we'll do some usability testing as well. So we'll bring bill from outside and it. For usability testing. I love to do give the sites on a mobile device to my son or daughter. I'd tell them, Hey, go ahead and add an item to the cart and just wash them or give the sights to my mom.</p><p>I always tell people if you can sell to my mom, he can sell to anybody. Cause she's not aware of all the latest and greatest those tasks to be very, very simple. The interface has to be very simple. we would look at also some of the competitors to just understand the competitive landscape. If there's interesting features that might be worth us considering.</p><p>Those different devotees are looking at the site through those different prisons and different ankles. Jeremy's humongous list of issues. we're that we need to optimize with one websites. We generated so 250 items, and I always tell people I'm like another started 50 items that are just my, our initial run through the website.</p><p>each one of them could turn into. Quick fix, look and lose. There's something broke over here. Just, just go ahead and fix it. We don't need to test or no, there are certain things where we know that's, you know what? We actually need to spend some more time analyzing their behavior, or we come up with a new design.</p><p>So that's kind of generally the process that we've run through for over </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:19:19] 10 years now, all my diet of advisers about evidence based conversion optimization with a focus on data and psychology. We see that analyzing data and recognizing customer behavior results in a better online dialogue with your clients in a higher ROI, that team of strategists, analysts, psychologists, and UX specialists gathered valuable insights in online behavior of your visitors.</p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:19:41] And together with you </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:19:42] optimize the different elements of your Ciero program through redesigned expert reviews, AB test and behavioral analysis. For more information about their services, go to Owen dialogue. And how do you feel about, I mean, this is just an expert to refuel rise. I also have this list and on the one hand, this is the easiest way you can sell Shiro to our clients because you can do a stand alone on the other end.</p><p>I don't actually want to do an expert. Right. I don't think if I would advise you as a client, I wouldn't advise an expert review. I would say let's go do, do user research with actual clients. </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:20:23] Yeah, it's a, it's an all honesty is it's a fun show. we have a large client. They're an SEO company, very well established, perhaps one of the first SEO companies in the U S been doing SEO now for 25 years.</p><p>And they came to us and this, I know the owner, he said, I'd like to do a CRO audits. I tell him, okay, well, let me understand. We actually have done a CRO audit for them, I think two years ago. And they took our recommendation and they implement it and he's like, you know, he's like, we didn't see a huge increase in conversions.</p><p>So I'm like, okay, so he's like, let's do another expert review. And I told him, I'm like, look, let me be very honest with you. And expert review is just my opinion and grade that you appreciate my opinion and you think I'm an expert, but your users might have a completely different opinion. So let's do that.</p><p>The abuser research now. I'm thinking to myself, and this is kind of, we're always putting ourselves in the shoes of our clients. I think to myself, I'm going to benefit my client. Correct. And it's like, it's much better for you. He's thinking, Oh man, this is going to be expensive of lengthier than a CRO audits.</p><p>That's the reality of it. Now we actually managed to convince them to go through the process of user research and we're going through this process with them or we're like, okay, let's do the user research lessons with jobs to be done interviews. let's go through this process to uncover issues on the website.</p><p>And it's sort of interesting. So they do this company because they're an SEO company, they do SEO audits and he was telling me, he's like, you know, CRO audits are different. So you don't do an expert. If you want to do a user research, I'm like, yes. And then he's like with an SEO audits, they tell the client specifically fix one, two, three, four, five, six seller stuff, things that you need to fix on the site with a CRO audit.</p><p>We don't tell them, fix one, two, three, four, because we tell them you need to test one, two, three, four. And by the way, this first idea, you need to do that three, four other things. It's like. This doesn't work. And I'm like, yeah, that's the challenge with CRL audits. They're easy to sell, you know, there are smaller engagements, but how much the client benefits from them.</p><p>It's, it's a tough question to answer. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:22:15] Exactly. Yeah. It's definitely what I tried to do is, the list of items to have those come from previous research, like, Nielsen Norman group, or a CXL or whatever research I can find. so at least base it on something besides my own opinion, but still, and, and it's not necessarily well, necessarily cheaper, right?</p><p>I mean, I'm doing user research. It's not that doesn't have to be that expensive, especially when you're starting out. </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:22:42] Well, it depends. So, so we conduct two different types of user research. The. Jobs to be done interviews typically, right? We tell our clients we'll conduct 20 hours of job interviews just to be done interviews.</p><p>Each one of them is about an hour. So 20 interviews, 20 hours, there's 20 hours that need to happen before and 20 hours needs to happen after analyzing and then pulling all that data. When cuffs, just to do jobs, to be done interviews you're at about the a hundred to 120 hours. And this is just the user research versus an expert to use.</p><p>So with us, one of the benefits of doing CRO for so long is we've conducted close to 15,000 AB tests at this point. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:23:18] That's a, that's a great, base of, of, of data that you have that you can use for that. Right? </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:23:21] Exactly. But you know, what's for each recommendation that I give you, I can literally pull up and I can tell you, I'm looking off this recommendation with 20 clients that worked really well and generated an average uplift of 7%, but with three clients, it actually reduced conversion rates.</p><p>And with, yeah. And I look at this data and I'm like, I mean, I'll make a recommendation, an educated recommendation. But it's challenging. It really is not easy. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:23:41] Yeah, exactly. So you just spoke about, also with higher management, it can be hard to convince them of, of, of experimenting in itself. so how do you go about, basically, training your clients and helping implements.</p><p>A culture of experimentation at the company and as you've worked for him, but assuming you, you also think that that's something you need even to do your job and to keep doing, to keep the client, </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:24:07] the, the, the process that we follow. One of our, we run a project, we refer to it as ship scrutinized, hypothesize implement and propagates, and, and like there's differences.</p><p>That scrutinizes, when you find all the different problems, we just talked about hypothesis, you create bought the Cynthia, the design implemented. Did you run? They be testing the last portion propagate as the education. Yeah, we have learned the hard way. That without client education, you can have the most successful project you're generating uplift, but if you're not educating the client, if you're not sharing the wins, if you're not sharing the learnings from the experimentation program, you're not able to keep the clients for a very long time.</p><p>So. I remember a large enterprise client. They sign up with us. The CTO is very excited and he he's the one who sponsored the project and I'm like CTO, but company let's come on. And they're one of the top 10 companies online actually. So I'm like, Oh, well, they don't even have an experimentation program.</p><p>Look at this, we're going to do something really amazing. Six months later, we finally managed to launch our first aid test. I always refer to it. I am willing to venture and say, it's the most explosive to ever launch. To make things worse. We don't generate a single uplift from that AB test sitting with the CTL and he's like six months single AB tests.</p><p>I'm looking at him and he looks at me, he's like, and there is no uplift. Like yes there, no. I was like, we paid this much for a single AB does. Now the nice thing is the director has director was sitting there and he explained to him that we had 23 iterations. You you're given feedback on the AB testing and modifications.</p><p>what, where it's powerful is that the same company that we're talking about now, their development team, and since they used to have a large development team and they used to call it the agile, but there, it wasn't really agile. Now it's split to 17 different teams. now every single feature that gets rolled out to the site is, goes through an AB test process and experimentation process.</p><p>Now it took about four or five years to get to that point where it just really ingrained in the culture. took a lot of hard work, but now they turned from two from, Oh gosh, we've wasted so much money into it. Oh, gosh, we have to do it this way. This is how we succeed. That's the reason I think client education initially when it comes to here's the process that we're going to follow and then sharing the wins sharing, like, you know, and then saying, Hey, we've had this one over here.</p><p>Can we actually take it to your BC team and see what they can do with it? the, the, the best example that I, as we were running testing for dish network, which is a large satellite provider for DV services, we would take the wins. From what we've done online and they would use them and they, advertising that they did a newspapers, had lines, you know, inserts.</p><p>And I think out of like 17 or 18 different tests, only one of them did not generate 10 uplift. Now it's not the same uplift, but 17 or like, Oh, here, now we can even multiply here your winnings and guess what? That turned them into two believers as well. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:27:08] Yeah. I think for me a really important milestone is always, usually when you get in.</p><p>developers see AB testing and experimentation as extra work, cause it needs to do it on top of whatever their feature they're developing, right now as really important milestone. When you get to a point where the development team starts understanding no, no, we should be facilitating things before we build them.</p><p>And then it saves us time. I think for me it always feels like a big win. If I reached that point. </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:27:38] If the developers start thinking and I listened by the way to the language that developers use. Yeah, because developers and me coming from a development background, we'd like to have the best code and it looks really elegant and it's fun.</p><p>It doesn't matter whether users are going to use it or not. We don't think of it as the barbers, you know, I was like, great, that's amazing. Use it. Goddammit. but if a developer start thinking, Hey, I got this really quickly. We can test the functionality. And if users like it and start using it, plus enhance it.</p><p>If the developer says that he or she that's what the experimentation is all about and it's extreme, extremely powerful, but that's also another reason why with most of our clients, we handle the implementation ourselves. if you, if we had done this interview back in 2011 out of told you that most of my failed experiments, because we give ideas to our clients that we're waiting for development team to implement, but we're just sitting around and we used to have flags when we give the client our seventh or eighth experiments and they haven't implemented, we know that they're going to cancel the contract.</p><p>Cause they haven't implemented. What's the use of experimentation. That's the reason we switched to a mode where we have to implement the code, the experiments ourselves. Yeah. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:28:43] And, it was peak of 2011. Well, actually 210. I think your book, you wrote a book </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:28:48] on CRO. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:28:49] so now 10 years old. if you, if you would be writing an update for it for 2020, what would you change?</p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:28:57] So it's, it's sort of interesting because. The book and it talks about the, the, you know, the conversion framework, which was what we use for our expert reviews, kind of the different analysis. There's so many different things that we want to change. Of course, all the case studies need to be updated, but let's talk about the fundamental things we've introduced the process jobs to be done in the last couple of years.</p><p>And our clients have seen tremendous success as a result of that. There is nothing about jobs to be done in the book, because we just learned about the process two years ago. So that's a new chapter in the book. The book is when we first wrote it was talking about our process, but it didn't talk about the full, it talks about just the scrutinized phase and talks about the expert review portion.</p><p>So. When we run a project there's 16 different steps to the book talks about the only one step in the process of conversion optimization. How can expert review without the elements you do evaluate? I would say about 20, 95% of the book needs updating, but the, I would write a new book, go about the whole process on how you actually run an end to end conversion optimization program.</p><p>That will be, I think a lot more useful nowadays SiteSpect </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:30:04] offers a worldwide unique AB testing, personalization and product recommendation solution SiteSpect works, service sides without any tags or scripts, which guarantees an optimal performance. The SiteSpect solution eliminates delays and the chance of any </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:30:19] flickering effects.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:30:20] And this approach also ensures that the current and future browser </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:30:24] stretcher rules </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:30:24] like ITP and ETP don't make an impact on your AB testing and personalization of more info. Visit &nbsp;dot com. That's going to be a huge uptime.</p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:30:39] Or a second, yeah. Book, because it's funny because as I was talking to our publisher recently, our editor and because it was like, we need to like an update to the book and. When we published the book, there was, there was only two other books about conversion optimization written at that point in time. So he pulls the list and he's like, he looks at me and says, she's like, he's like you recognize there's 70 other books written about conversion optimization since then.</p><p>Yes. I recognize the field has changed so much. And I told him. No, it needs to be a new book. I mean, yes, there are some updates to this one, but there should be a new book completely. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:31:11] Yeah. Trailblazer four to four to zero books. That's good. </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:31:15] Ah, there you go. At least we try, we try. Exactly. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:31:19] So you can, you could try to do that again with, your next book.</p><p>If, if 10 years later there's 70 books on a topic, then, then you did </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:31:26] that, right. There you go, there you go. That's actually, and I mentioned this to you when we were kind of exchanging emails, when we decided, you know, what are we going to release our, training? Like, you know, the CRO mastery training where we said, you know what, we've been doing this training.</p><p>So we do the training all across the globe. Now, last time I did it, I was in, I was in Singapore. Long, long flight that can tell you that much 24 hours almost. And we do the training usually around the U S and now we're stuck. And I'm like, Oh, well maybe we finally record this training. And I'm like, okay, well, how do you take that training and convert it into a book, you know, things to ponder and another project to add to the list of things online course, that's actually what we have.</p><p>So the CRL mastery is of course, yes, we released it about a month ago and I think we are. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:32:10] So why did you go to Singapore for an online course? </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:32:13] Well, no, at that point it was an actual, an actual conference. They invited they're like, Hey, you know, and I, Oh, I am, I'm like, I've never flown to like, you know, East Asia.</p><p>I'm like, Oh, good reasons. Like, you know, take a break, fly there, discover a new culture and, and teach conversion optimization </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:32:27] at the Singapore's a nice city to pick that </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:32:29] out. Definitely. Definitely. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:32:31] That's a good one. So, if you look forward to the next, say, say next year, how would you like to.</p><p>Change the way that you work with, with clients on zero, what would you like to improve? maybe on their side or on your side? </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:32:45] There are several things that I think every CRO should think about, about this challenge. I always think about kind of what are the big challenges. And I think if we are able to sell them, then clients will benefit more from or services and we can keep those clients much longer and we can have there.</p><p>Visitor's happier because we're creating a more user friendly website. I think one of the struggles that many CRS face is figuring out how do I show my client the exact ROI that I'm generating as a result of my work? cause the client would like that. Oh, definitely. we gotta figure out a way to do that.</p><p>Now we have few things that we've been experimenting with. they're not easy to implement, but eventually the minutes we'll figure this out. We want to roll that out. I think that will be very interesting. There's a lot, the focus on experimentation on AB testing, but in all honesty, if you think about, if you peel the onion.</p><p>And you'll look at all the different AB testing software out there from the optimized way to VW. And we have our own, a dusting software that we released. We've used it with clients for many years now. We made it available to the public. If you peel the onion, They're all very simple, correct. One version of the website.</p><p>Here's another version I'm going to split visitors and I'm going to see the uplift. Exactly. It's that, </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:33:58] especially if you, if you use Google something like Google analytics to do the analysis anyway, so exactly. </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:34:03] So I will stop here and. AB things, companies struggle with that, by the way. So I'll give you an example, optimized lead.</p><p>They're like, Oh, so we've built the software. What do we do next? So they go to personalization. They couldn't figure out what to do is like quit or we'll just add something else. VWO and, and, been long time user of VW. I've done the guys when they first started, they said, Oh no, we're going to add the full conversion optimization platform.</p><p>We're going to do session replays and heat. Again, they're stuck. And I think what needs to happen when it comes to a B testing software is to figure out how we can use AI. Or machine learning to actually enhance the customer experience on the website. And I was stopping on like nowadays people use AI very loosely, you know, that's like everybody has AI.</p><p>And I was like, this is really not AI. If you have . Exactly. I know there's a big distinction, correct. Between the two, if we can figure out a way to use AI. To an end like genetic algorithms where you figure out different versions of the websites and how you can actually enhance those genetic versions of the different websites to present users with a better experience.</p><p>That will be powerful. Now I know that there's experiments ascent, for example, is trying to do that and they have some interesting. Some interesting work and trying to achieve that. They're still not there, but I think that will be interesting to see in two, three years from now and how that would work the whole Google policy around cookies.</p><p>And I'm not even going to get into that time, how that's going to impact us. That will be also huge. So it will be interesting couple of years actually, when it comes to conversion optimization, </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:35:37] final point, you you've written a book, but do you, do, do you have any recommendations for our audience in terms of books?</p><p>Are you an avid reader or? </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:35:45] Oh my God. I, I, yes, I am. I'm always looking at, I always have four or five books next to my head that I'm constantly reading. Here's what I think it's easy to you open a blog post, correct. And read. And there's some, by the way, some amazing resources when it comes to conversion optimization as available, I think what Pat and the guys at CXL have done.</p><p>It's just tremendous because they really revolutionize the industry. our blog, I always think is our blog is kind of the second most popular blog. I think pep gets about 300,000 visitors a month. We get about a hundred thousand visitors. So it's like quite, quite a task to try and catch up with them, but investing the time and picking the right book.</p><p>And Jim thinks of the time to read books and delve deep. That requires commitment and not, everybody's willing to put that commitment by the way. Now, if you pick any topic and you choose two, three, four, five books on it, and you read about it, guess what that elevates your next thing is you just figure out a way how to implement that, that knowledge.</p><p>some of the books that I really love reading and, and they're more business, but the roadless stupid is one of my favorite books that I've read that I continue reading just about running business and talks about. All the mistakes business owners make and that the stupid tax that Bay I was talking, I'm like, Oh my God, if I think about the stupid off paid running ambassador in the last 15 years, I must have wasted a couple of million dollars on silly things.</p><p>And now I read this book and it's like, Oh my God, you're pointing out to me all the mistakes I've made. So. there's couple of books on differentiation. I think that's another big thing. Whether you're a CRO or you're an eCommerce or a SAS company, we live in a time where everything, but he looks the same.</p><p>Correct. and that's what we suffer from the problem of sameness. we were doing a usability test for, for eBay. And we're trying to turn to test the search functionality on the, just to see how it works. And we bring a whole bunch of people. They're testing iPhone 11 to see if people and I'm watching there.</p><p>And this guy searches on eBay for iPhone 11. Doesn't like the search functionality. It goes to Google, puts insights, ebay.com. You know, I found 11 second result. It's not the eBay. It's actually Amazon. Remember, we're doing these about this for eBay. The guy clicks on the Amazon result adds the iPhone 11 to his baskets.</p><p>He's going through the check and I'm standing there watching him. And I thought, where are you going? He's like, well, I'm finishing the task that you asked me to do on the you're on the wrong side. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:38:10] Yeah. Yeah. That's something that I've also seen in, in user research. That's that blows my mind when people just go through a different, so I did research for a price comparison websites, which buyer, redirects people do a different website, but people.</p><p>Thought they were buying from the price comparison website. And I already knew from, from the, people, working at the help desk from the price comparison website, like 20% of the phone calls is people that have a question about the product that they bought. Well, I'm sorry he's at him, but I'm pretty sure he didn't buy it from us because we actually don't sell anything.</p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:38:46] There you go. It's a huge conquer. This problem of sameness. We all look the same, whether you're CRO consultants, how do you distinguish yourself from other CRO consultants? You know, whether you are an eCommerce offsite, how do you distinguish yourself? Cause everything has been commoditized. Product services, you know, I've been commoditized.</p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:39:05] Isn't that something that's a pep is also a writing about lately. I think he's writing a book on it or something like </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:39:10] that. He is so like, you know, I think we both are like funny because I've been writing on LinkedIn for awhile and then he's also, he's like, Oh, I saw him in January and he's like, Oh, I'm writing a book about it.</p><p>I'm like, Oh really? Because it's such, such an important topic. and I think if you're able as a business to figure out how to stand out. That's how you really going to be able to capture a segment of the market. That always mentioned a story. So we have this company reached out, reaches out to us and says, Hey, we want to hire a CRO company.</p><p>I'm talking to them. They're large. And the project is really nice. It's like almost like a, not 20, $25,000 a month for a 12 months engagement. So I'm talking to their COO and he's not called by the way. We're also talking to CXL to wider funnel, kind of the usual suspects that we always compete with. So I'm thinking to myself, I have evolved because I can sell better than anybody else.</p><p>I get to know the CMO were presented to him two weeks later, you know, we're really, we established that relationship and I call him, I'm trying to find out what's going on. And actually conversion rate experts were also on that, on that part. Some talking to them, the guy's name is Michael and I'm like Michael.</p><p>So you've listened to us. You've listened. CXL, you've listened to wider funnel to CRE what do you think. How do we stand up? And now I have thought to myself, by the way I stepped out from, from them. That's what I, and he just he's like call it. Can I be very honest with you? I'm like, sure. He's like Collin, you guys all sound the same.</p><p>If I did not know who I'm talking to use out executive, same as CXL as CRE as wider fund is like, there's no difference. It's like the differences are so low now that's really hits me in the face. I'm like, Oh really? I might think that I'm different, but here my prospective clients has told me you're the same, you know?</p><p>So how do I distinguish myself? So since then, this was back in 2015. Differentiation and how you stand out is a big thing that I always ask myself and ask my team </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:40:56] like blue ocean strategy or other books that you, what kind of books do you, see on this topic? </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:41:01] Bang. I can, I wish that there is a really good book, two to click it, to kind of look for, I think there's a book competing against luck.</p><p>very powerful. It talks about jobs to be done, but it talks about also differentiation. That's very, very powerful blue ocean strategy. I love that book as well. I must have read. Oh, 15, 20 books about the topic. And in each of them, I have them all my Kindle sections highlighted. Then I look at them and the problem is not in the theory, correct, but the problems in the implementation.</p><p>Cause I can tell you the theory is very simple. Create a, create a unique experience. Everybody can copy my process. No one can copy the experience. Okay. Great. Well, What does that mean? There you go. You know, how do I actually create that experience? That's a lot more difficult. </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:41:42] Any final books you want to zip?</p><p>Ah, </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:41:43] I think all the books that I can think of fleeing up, especially I've been up. Like I told you, I've been up since 3:00 AM, so.</p><p>That's like reading books, read books, doing calls, you know, I think I've done my all at the same time. I woke up my wife and she was like, Oh, how's your day. I told her. I'm like, you know, I've had seven calls and I'm about to jump on a podcast recording as well. She's like, wow. It's such like productive day.</p><p>Like a typical day. There you </p><p>Guido Jansen: [00:42:06] go. Very good. Thank you so much for, for joining me on the, on the podcast and sharing your thoughts about the CRO industry. Much appreciated. I think. Thanks. Thanks so much for your time. Well, </p><p>Khalid Saleh: [00:42:16] thank you for having me. I appreciate you having me as well as the guests. Thank you.</p><p>Bye bye. Bye.</p><p>‍</p>",,36a54bd8

You should be testing better. Oh, you shouldn't be testing more efficiently. How's it going for you? Not very well. I think I need to come down on the ground and talk to people </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:01:25] this way. You're sitting on the chair right </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:01:27] here right now, and then later I'll go out and tell them about that.</p><p>That makes sense. Hopefully they'll stick around hopefully. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:34] And, why? </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:01:36] I got invited to the Dutch. CRO awards. Yep. And I've prepared my talk in English clues should have been in the name, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:45] It should have been, </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:01:46] it should have been, I should have brushed up on my Dutch so far. Facebook autocomplete has been helping with it, but I don't think it will help me with my talk.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:54] Fair enough. Fair enough. So what are you going to talk about? </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:01:56] the thing I'm talking about is how. without revealing too much immediately before the talk, isn't it? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:02] Yeah. That's what the previous guest said too. But I have a pretty strong feeling that people listening to not </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:02:09] know. And I'm guessing that they're not in the room actually listening to us.</p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:02:13] That's why the connection crashing. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:16] Everyone's on the wifi, listening to the live stream in the same location. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:02:19] Yeah. so the content of the talk is. it's about conversion optimization to the next level. everywhere, where we go in our own little bubbles, our communities, our Facebook groups, our conferences, et cetera.</p><p>There's a whole emphasis on the technical aspects of CRO and the experiments that we've run in the uplifts and stuff like that. But I think there's a world out there. That conversion optimization is still yet to make a big impact on which is the business they work in. And you might say, yeah, but they are doing some really good tests and stuff, but more and more, what I keep hearing is that conversion optimizers are complaining about, we don't have buy-in, we don't have dev resources.</p><p>how, why am I getting asked about, to prove my ROI every time? Those are questions that are coming from what I've. Thought of as well established CRO programs. So why is that happening? And so then this talk, I'm going to explore that and also touch upon this topic of culture of experimentation, which I believe is a waste of time.</p><p>But if it's done incorrectly, as it is being done right now, that's when it's a waste of time. It's let's say, you are a weight loss guru, a diet guru says, how can I lose weight? eat healthy. Great, but how do I tell you? He tells me nothing, there's no kind of direction and stuff.</p><p>So over the last two years at effective experiments, we've been observing and working with our customers and people that we know and trying to really understand what works and what doesn't work, and to create a structured approach to getting this culture of experimentation and addressing. These problematic recurring problems that come up every time buying the resource.</p><p>And because all of that is the symptom of the problem, which is well, CRO is conversion optimization is still asylum within marketing, within a department. And my job standing on top of that rooftop is trying to shut and get people to see that there is actually a bigger business that needs to understand the value of it because I'm a firm believer in experimentation.</p><p>It is a driver for innovation, but we can't be, just be scratching the surface. We need to be doing more. And so that's the content of the talk. Going to be sharing the framework called the cave model. Oh, nice. Yeah. I couldn't come up with anything else. and, and </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:42] rooftops, caves, </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:04:43] rooftops, caves subways next year.</p><p>Yeah. so that's basically what I'm talking about. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:48] Great. and so do you have the feeling that, zero specialists are approaching it wrong? Are they. Not approaching, not looking at the culture or doing it wrong, or </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:04:59] they're doing it wrong. no one goes into a job to say, yeah, I'm going to do it wrong today.</p><p>They're going in with the best intentions. And as I said, the gurus out there that the people out there that are putting on blogs and stuff are basically talking about the right things. Like we should be growing a culture of experimentation. We should be sharing stuff. We should be, getting people involved in our testing programs.</p><p>That is all well-intentioned stuff, but when they go out there and try and do it, they basically in this boardroom where people are yawning and completely unengaged, And this is not just a problem for CRO it's a problem for SEO. It's a problem for PPC. And the key thing that we forget. And as I said earlier, where we're in a bubble, We sat in this bubble where we are patting ourselves on the backs and say, wow, you did a good test. Oh, you did a good test. Look at my test. And everyone's we've elevated ourselves with this false sense of amazement that we were doing stuff. And my friend, Tim Stewart has a really good take on that as he says, We see our role.</p><p>We think of ourselves as Avengers, right? The superheroes, but we're actually, we should be agents of shield, which is the low level people that are doing the hard work to get the stuff done. And so we need to take our own egos out of it and really make that difference in the organization. And going back to </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:06:17] that's my question.</p><p>What's the main problem with. Let's say having one full time, CRO, in your company and then doing tough testing things out, doing user research and then sharing that. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:06:28] what's the main issue with it? The main issue is this, right? You mentioned you were from an SEO background as well, is that correct?</p><p>Yeah. and let's say you went and let's say three of us, A PPC and SEO and a CRO walks into a bar or a cafe or yeah. Yeah. I see what he did there. See what he did there, but, Like you could tell me all about your tags and your technical. So you're going to be like, okay, now listen to my amazing stuff.</p><p>And then the PPC person. Okay, good. Now listen to my amazing stuff. What's happening over there. You're listening in one year, and then you're just trying to shout out about what you're doing. That's basic human behavior. You want to show how valuable you are, right. And the other person putting it plainly doesn't care.</p><p>This is human behavior because </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:07:13] everyone sees thinking what's in it for me. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:07:16] You got one of my slides on there. So that's my story. That's fine. They're not watching it. Yeah, exactly. So what's in it for me. Yeah. So this is why people in that boardroom are there. The other, another slide don't share in this talk as well is sharing stuff, right?</p><p>I've done all this work and sharing, putting it on dashboards, putting it on email reports and stuff. If you, if I walk past massive TV screens with stock market information, it's being shared. Yeah. But I don't know. It's been </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:07:46] being transmitted. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:07:47] Yeah. It's been transmitted, but it's not being transmitted there because I don't follow the stock market.</p><p>I don't have any understanding of the stock market and I have no interest in the stock market, so you could put it up all day and I'll be like, whatever. So this is it. It's the same thing that's happening in organizations when we're being told to share. All we're doing is we're trying to get the stuff out, push it out there.</p><p>And people are walking past because they've got to run to their next meeting. Yeah. So it's not that they're doing it wrong. It's, they're missing a few steps before that. Think of it. if you're, playing a man to run a marathon, You're planning to run a marathon, do you start running straight away, full speed or whatever you take different steps, your nutrition, or whatever.</p><p>Everything needs to happen before you're fit enough to go and run that marathon. And what I feel is it's not that they are doing it wrong is they've missed out. A lot of the steps are I'm going way back. They've missed out a lot of the steps before that, which is </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:08:39] which results in people not caring.</p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:08:41] Correct? Correct. So I, as I said, that sharing stuff is great, but it's </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:46] it looks like we have a winner. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:08:50] Thank </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:08:50] you. Alright. Thank you. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:08:53] Thank you. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:08:54] Thank you. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:08:56] I don't know. As one.</p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:09:00] I'm not saying </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:09:01] it's not a slide. And so I don't. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:09:03] Oh, I think I'm, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:09:05] who's a rocket. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:09:06] Yeah. Okay.</p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:09:15] Yeah. so would you, say that, for example, the differences between a CRO running a test about, I don't know, a unique selling point and then not </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:09:25] saying </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:09:26] to different departments like SEO, like we found the issue is being is better or worse in these cases than this one, or is it, Saying we found a dish USP works better than this USP.</p><p>And maybe for SEO, you can do this or that with it. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:09:41] That is the second approach is a lot better. But again, it's about getting people involved even before that. Cause again, it's, we ran a podcast conversion nations. I'll just plug that in anyways. in that podcast there was this guy called Alex Abel, and he said really.</p><p>That problem, why what's in it for me can be solved really easily while I say easily, it does take time, but you have to go out and actually talk to people, not about your stuff, but about learning about your stuff. So when I'm sat with you, I want to learn, about your SEO work. I want to learn about what your KPIs are, what your challenge, we're making conversation.</p><p>We're building that connection, but more importantly, I'm understanding the context with which I need to approach you with. Yeah, because then if I come in and say, Oh, I found this USP. It's because I have learned in that conversation that we had, that is important to you. And if I can help you meet your goal, you will help me meet my goal.</p><p>And so conversion optimization. There's two aspects of it. There's the functional aspect. You can't be without that </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:41] A bit. But it's mainly about, doing that with, your colleagues on the same level, or is it also </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:10:46] a everyone in the organization? at some point or the other, And that's what takes time and that's what takes the effort.</p><p>So there's two aspects of it. There's the functional aspect of experimentation, which is you're running an AB test doing your research, writing up your report and all that kind of stuff. And the second aspect, which I feel is not being done enough or done properly is the transformational aspect. Because what is conversion optimization at the end of the day, at the core of it?</p><p>What is it's about moving your business, improving the business. It's innovation. It's about business transformation. It's not about moving widgets on the page. It's not about if we think as optimizes, right? When we're optimizing a page, we optimize it for the benefits. We're not optimizing it for the features we're optimizing for the benefit.</p><p>Similarly, the work we do, it's not about, yeah. We run some AB tests. Yeah, we're helping the business, understand the customers. We're helping move, the revenue move up, helping them retain estimates and so on and so forth. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:11:41] Even it can go as far as creating new business models or adjust existing subscription model, you have </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:11:47] completely correct, but.</p><p>The challenge that we face now. And this is something that Jeffrey Eisenberg who coined conventional said back in 2016, when I ran convert or conversion world, he said, conversion, optimizers are seen as like the dirt under the fingernails people. And they haven't been given a seat at the table where C-level makes all those big decisions.</p><p>All those big decisions are made. But where the conversion optimizers over there, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:14] it's weird because there's already a C in the name. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:12:16] yeah. So we started out </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:18] with the three letter acronym, starting with a C we started out, </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:12:21] Hey, that's it that's a different topic, right? because we had this whole thing about.</p><p>Should we be calling it CRO and then we said, no, we should be calling in bro business rate optimization. Yeah. And it's terrible </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:12:33] acronyms going around. </p><p>but that's for the, the, the bigger companies, the guys that have teams for this and what about </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:12:40] the smaller company? And so here's the interesting thing when I've talked to smaller companies and, you'll have one zero and stuff, they feel.</p><p>That they shouldn't need to do all this stuff because they're small. They don't really need to do that. Yeah. But my, my honest answer to them is you need to do it even more. You need to do it even more because if you want to scale up, if you have any ambition to scale up, and if you have any ambition to bring people on, you need to be setting those foundations down ASAP.</p><p>You can't just say I'm going to do the technical work. It's important. There's no two ways about it. But to make it accessible, there's a lot more that isn't being done. And this is, primarily the core thing of my talk. And also going to be introducing this new concept, a word we've climbed based on the findings we've had, and we're calling it experiment ops.</p><p>It's a collection. It's basically it defines all the processes, the people and the work that needs that goes in with one aim. Yeah. And that aim is about helping the business, understand the value of experimentation and changing that culture. Because ultimately, what have we seen? We've seen that if there's the right culture, if there's the right experimentation mindset, you will get ideas from everywhere.</p><p>You'll get people willing to give you those resources because they know the value of testing. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:13:58] But that doesn't, I agree, but doesn't that mean that maybe you're at the wrong conference? </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:14:03] Maybe I </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:14:04] shouldn't you be at a conference for four CEOs? </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:14:07] Maybe I should. I did ask you that, right? Yeah, maybe I am.</p><p>But what I'm trying to do is trying to inspire this crowd because this isn't a watcher, And they're already buzzing about the good work and I want to inspire them to take it to that next level, because what I don't want to see. Is people being fired because they've not proven the value of CRO. I don't want to see teams being disbanded.</p><p>I don't want to see CRO being seen as like second fiddle to marketing. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:14:33] Yeah, we do so many to CRO something like that. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:14:36] Yeah. So I want the people in this room to be valued, if they are trying to change the business, they're trying to explore new business models. These are the people they should be approached.</p><p>How can we test this business model? How can we improve it right now? If all we're doing is moving stuff around the page. We lend a, becoming a commodity. SEO went through that. I don't know where it is now, but it did go through that first page of Google, all that kind of stuff. And so as CRO as well, we might end up being the same thing, like a commodity, and that's what I'm keen to avoid.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:09] So what's the happy end of your story. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:15:12] The happy end is that framework and it's given them some action points. Yup. Seemed really </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:17] happy. The happy end is you should do more work. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:15:19] Yeah. ingrained CRO into entire business and you as an CRO consultant or as somebody who works in that field is the first person who should start doing </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:15:31] that.</p><p>Even as a team of one, it's your responsibility to set the ground rules and said the set of the foundations for it, just because you're small doesn't mean that you and a lot of it. Is not to do with like hard work. It's all about being disciplined and setting those structures, setting the processes.</p><p>Because lot of times where I speak to people and effective experiment, we're all about process. We're all about structure and stuff. And when people approach us, they're like, we don't have any structure or it's all over the place. Why is it all over the place? we didn't really, at that time, it didn't worry us.</p><p>And. That's my point. It's like that early on. If you're, if you don't think about it, when it's, I compare it to this analogy to noon down that road and trying to change it as you're going, That's not possible. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:16:16] Yeah. You have no idea what we can do with </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:18] bicycle. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:16:20] Your Dutchies. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So that's essentially the message that it is a positive thing.</p><p>I'm not trying to talk down any people. There's some good work being going on over here. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:16:30] And do you think it would help if a CRO, for example, when they come up with ideas or prioritize or things like that, basically go to the SEO team or PPC or whatever team and ask them, what are your struggles? And can, maybe I can run an experiment to help you get an answer.</p><p>Do you think? Oh, definitely. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:16:48] Definitely. you want to do it. You want to do it really casual first rather than go on and tell them, what do you want? So the casual things is again, those coffees or lunch, and learn sessions. Keeping it really casual. And the agenda is like knowledge sharing, right?</p><p>And you start with that, you don't start with work, you start with making it fun and then gradually they will come to you and they'll say, Hey, I've got this problem. Can you help me validate this? Then, you're onto a winner and here's the thing it's not going to happen overnight. You'll have lots of coffees.</p><p>You'll have lots of lunches and everything, and you may not see any change. But it'll happen over time. That's what I said. It's a discipline and maintaining that consistency. And that's where you'll start to get. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:28] When you talk about it takes some time can </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:17:32] take years, man can take years, but this is what I feel like CRO when they join an organization that has to be a plan.</p><p>For longterm with that Tiara, unless there's something really bad about that person and they're really rubbish or their job, that person should be definitely many years. Yeah. Because you can't transform a business with a one year contract. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:55] but that's something we need to change on the management level.</p><p>So that's not something that single </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:17:59] person </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:00] that has a six month or 12 month contracts. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:18:02] Nope. You can't do that. And that I feel those type of contracts are something that as a CRA should avoid as well, just because it doesn't give you an enough breathing room to make change on the testing level, let alone the transformational level.</p><p>Yeah. So you put yourself in a corner or already, I know it's a job and people want that job. And I might be being a bit naive and idealistic and saying, don't go for those jobs. But the only way we can make that change is by setting those rules. if you think of it, how are people hiring right now?</p><p>Because if CRM is so new, right? Management's just Oh yeah, we needed a CRO because they can increase our conversions and stuff. That's the mindset. They don't know any better. So when you said I should be talking to CEOs and CMOs. Yeah. I think I should be because I should be helping them understand how to hire better, how to set those expectations.</p><p>It was what to expect from the CRO. How long should they be working? That's the key over here. And so the change has to happen on both levels. It's not like just these guys changing the way they work and their management's whatever. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:19:04] And helping companies become, avoid becoming the next Kodak by really understanding what they do, what visitors value, </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:19:11] that's the thing.</p><p>and, I, hopefully as I said, these guys can be inspired to take it back, but if we start on this level, we can't change that level sometimes, immediately we're trying to do business transformation, It doesn't happen overnight. But if these guys start putting in those. practices in the company, the management starts seeing it.</p><p>They start becoming more aware of it. And once you unlock that awareness, that's when you can start making that change. Yeah. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:36] Does that? I can imagine that at effective experiments, it's a tool it's bragged management tool for CRO. and it can imagine that, when, I think that's not our awards show, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:19:45] I think </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:19:47] probably, yeah, we're gonna go and jump into a song or something </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:52] that would be nice.</p><p>So monumental. when companies, need your tool, if they already have a CRO program, and they think, okay, everything is really messed up. We need something to fix this, then they come to you. But I can imagine that's the, door's not the </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:20:08] solution. It's not the solution. And I've also told them that because sometimes, and I've turned people away because of this is because they come in with that mentality of Hey, we need this automatic solution that can fix us.</p><p>And I tell them, no, our tool is centralizing stuff and it facilitates stuff I want. The people in this room to be valued. And if they are trying to change the business, they're trying to explore new business models. These are the people that should be approached. How can we test this business model?</p><p>How can we improve it right now? If all we're doing is moving stuff around the page. We lend to becoming a commodity. SEO went through that. I don't know where it is now, but it did go through that first page of Google, all that kind of stuff. And so I see our role as well. we might being the same thing, like a commodity and that's what I'm keen to avoid.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:58] so what's the happy end of your story. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:21:00] The happy end is that framework, give them some action points. Yup. Seems really </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:05] happy. you should do more work. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:21:07] Yeah, no people just </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:21:09] leave after that. I need to get some more work done. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:12] Maybe you should let them get drinks first. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:21:15] yeah. Yeah. That'll be a good, that'll be a good thing.</p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:21:17] So basically the, the final message is try to. engrain CRO into the entire business and you as an CRO consultant or as somebody who works in that field is the first person who should start doing </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:21:30] that. Even as a team, you have one it's your responsibility to set the ground rules and said the set of the foundations for it, just because you're small doesn't mean that you and a lot of it.</p><p>Is not to do with like hard work. It's all about being disciplined and setting those structures, setting the processes. Because a lot of times where I speak to people, I think active experiments. We're all about our process. We're all about structure and stuff. And when people approach us, they're like, we don't have any structure or it's all over the place.</p><p>Why is it all over the place? we didn't really, at that time, it didn't worry us. And that's my point. It's like that early on. If you're, if you don't think about it, when it's, I compare it to this analogy of if I'm your tire bursts, When you're driving or cycling in Amsterdam, it's easier.</p><p>It's easier to change the tire on the side of the road. Then continuing down that road and trying to change it as you're going. That's not possible. Yeah. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:22:26] You have no idea what we can do with bicycle </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:22:31] Dutchies yeah. Cool. Yeah. So that's essentially the message that it is a positive thing. I'm not trying to talk down any people.</p><p>There's some good work being going on over here. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:22:41] Do you think it would help if a CRO, for example, when they come up with ideas or prioritize or things like that? basically go to the SEO team or PPC or whatever team and ask them, what are your struggles? And can, maybe I can run an experiment to help you get an answer.</p><p>Do you think that's a </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:22:57] good thing? Definitely. you want to do it. You want to do it really casual first, rather than go on and tell them like, what do you want? So the casual things is again, those coffees or lunch, and learn sessions. Keeping it really casual and the agenda is like knowledge sharing, right?</p><p>Yeah. And you start with that. You don't start with work, you start with making it fun and then gradually they will come to you and they'll say, Hey, I've got this problem. Can you help me validate this? Then, you're onto a winner and here's the thing it's not going to happen overnight. You'll have lots of coffees.</p><p>You'll have lots of lunches, everything, and you may not see any change. But it'll happen over time. That's what I say. It's a discipline and maintaining that consistency. And that's where you'll start in the winners. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:38] When you talk about it takes some </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:23:40] time can take years, man, and take years. But this is what I feel like a CRO.</p><p>When they join an organization, there has to be a plan. For a term with, without Tiara, unless there's something really bad about that person and they're really rubbish or their job, that person should be you definitely many years. Yeah. Because you can't transform a business with a one year contract.</p><p>Right, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:06] but that's something we need to change on the management level. So that was something that single person that has a six month or 12 month contract. Nope. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:24:13] You can't do that. And that I feel those types of contracts are something that as a CRA should avoid as well, just because it doesn't give you enough breathing room to make change on the testing level, let alone the transformational level.</p><p>Yeah. So you put yourself in a corner or already, I know it's a job and people want that job. And I might be being a bit naive and idealistic and saying, don't go for those jobs. But the only way we can make that change is by setting those rules. if you think of it, how are people hiring right now?</p><p>Because if CRM is so new, right? Management's just Oh yeah, we needed a CRO because they can increase our conversions and stuff. That's the mindset. They don't know any better. So when you said I should be talking to CEOs and CMOs. Yeah. I think I should be because I should be helping them understand how to hire better, how to set those expectations, what to expect from the CRO, how long should they be working?</p><p>That's the key over here? And so the change it has to happen on both levels. It's not like just these guys changing the way they work and their management's whatever. </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:25:15] And helping companies become an, avoid becoming the next Kodak by really understanding what they do, what visitors value. </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:25:22] That's the thing.</p><p>and, I, hopefully as I said, these guys can be inspired to take it back, but if we start on this level, we can't change that level sometimes, immediately we're trying to do business transformation, It doesn't happen overnight. But if these guys start putting in those. Practices in the company, the management starts seeing it.</p><p>They started becoming more aware of it. And once you unlock that awareness, that's when you can start making that change. Yeah. Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:47] Those that I can imagine that at effective experiments, it's a tool it's brag management tool for CRO. and it can imagine that, when, I think that's not our watch, </p><p>Bart van der Meer: [00:25:58] I think the stream is </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:26:00] probably </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:26:01] yeah.</p><p>Where he's going to go and jump into songs. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:26:04] Yeah. It would be nice. but Manuel, when companies, need your tool, if they already have a CRO program, and they think, okay, everything is really messed up. We need something to fix this, then they come to you. But I can imagine that's the door.</p><p>It's not the </p><p>Manuel DaCosta: [00:26:20] solution. The tool is not the solution. And I've also told them that because sometimes, and I've turned people away because of this is because they come in with that mentality of Hey, we need this. Automatic solution that can fix us. And I tell them, no, our tool is centralizing stuff and it facilitates stuff.</p><p>We're not promising a silver bullet that you put into your system. And then all of a sudden it's like magic. We're not that type of business that promotes that. Yeah. We help them because it centralizes stuff. And we see that by centralizing, it takes away the time. So they have more free time to do evangelizing and so on and so forth.</p><p>But really they need to put in the work. Yeah. So I can spot, depending on, the first few sentences they say, and what they're looking for, I can tell whether they are ready for it or not as well, regardless of what stage the company is at. </p>",,65c88289

Yeah. I, um, I actually started out as a front end developer.</p><p>So I'm self taught how to code. I taught myself when I was about 15 years old. Um, and then I went off to university and did a media arts and English, but my media course was really practical. So there was lots of Photoshop and I learnt how to record radio and edit video. Um, and part of my course, yeah, it was great.</p><p>It was really, really hands on, which is so unusual for a university course. But then I ended up specializing in website design because I already had a bit of a background. Who is code. Um, and then Australia. Yeah, I was working as a freelance web designer and developer for about nine or 10 years. So quite a long time working in digital.</p><p>Yeah. And then I took on a contract, um, with a B2B company and they were doing AB testing and I was like, this is quite interesting. This is, this is quite fun. Um, I'm one of those rare front end, double X front end developers. Um, That wasn't particularly attached to my code. Uh, I didn't, I wasn't precious about it at all.</p><p>If it needed changing, I was fine with it. Um, and that the whole appeal of AB testing was I could write some code, test it, see how it went. Um, and then, you know, if it didn't work out, then that's fine. You move on to the next thing. But because it was a B2B company, it took forever for us to get any kind of results of that, of that test.</p><p>Um, So then I actually moved on to a travel company and worked there for almost two years within their dedicated optimization team as a front end developer. So I was just building tests day in, day out. Right. Absolutely loved it. And I learned so much from my colleagues about AB testing process, experimentation analytics and all these things, which I had a little bit of knowledge about from.</p><p>Dabbling in it at the BTBY company and from my background in digital, but I'd never really followed a proper process, but because they already had a same ingrained, I learned so much. Um, so then I kind of. Turn that into my career, essentially. Um, and I worked, I worked with an eCommerce business for about two years, and then I went into contracting.</p><p>I've been contracting for the last gosh, almost three years now. Um, sort of moving around, helping, uh not-for-profits especially, but also, um, I really like focusing on small to medium sized businesses. Um, I really like going in and making a difference in doing the education piece around what experimentation is and, you know, helping them out with, with that research piece as well.</p><p>So I do quite have UX, um, with most of my contracts as well, so that UX piece, that analytics piece, um, and then helping them embed this process into their workflow. And I think the really nice thing about working for SMEs in particular, Is that, um, once you've made that impact, I told them what the benefits are of experimentation.</p><p>I can then. Leave that job, but leaves them in a position to hire someone permanently. So I feel like I'm opening up the job market for other CRS who want a permanent job, which isn't me at this point in my career. Um, but there's plenty of people out there that are looking to go in and make a difference and to work in CRO, um, So, yeah, I've really enjoyed.</p><p>We enjoyed doing that sort of work, um, in terms of what I'm doing at the moment. Um, I'm actually, I'm actually rolling down a lot of my contracts because, uh, I'm seven months </p><p>Guido: [00:03:38] pregnant. Congratulations. Thank you. </p><p>Elise: [00:03:40] Um, so I'm, I'm kind of planning on taking a bit of maternity leave for a couple of months, um, which means that most of my contracts at the moment are sort of winding down, um, helping find replacements, um, to sort of cover my maternity leave.</p><p>Um, And just, yeah, that's, that's kind of what I'm working on right now is sort of handover stuff more than anything else. </p><p>Guido: [00:04:01] Basically, you're creating a lot of jobs for everyone. Uh, and, and now extra work because of your freshmen pregnancy leave, </p><p>Elise: [00:04:08] uh, </p><p>Guido: [00:04:08] giving, giving work to everyone else in the industry.</p><p>That's really nice. </p><p>Elise: [00:04:12] It seems to be that way at the moment. Um, I, I'm sort of, I've been posting over the last couple of days about I'm on LinkedIn and on Twitter, about a couple of jobs that I've seen advertised. I'm just trying to connect. The right people to the right jobs. Um, and I'm like, I didn't, I didn't sign up to be a recruiter.</p><p>I've got a lot of respect for recruiters right now because there's an awful lot of chasing. Um, and I, I wasn't, I wasn't expecting to do that. So, um, yeah, but that's, that's kind of how I find it to see how our and what I'm doing right </p><p>Guido: [00:04:39] now. I'm curious, like I just said, no one studies hero. So I think you, you also rolled into it.</p><p>Was it mainly, um, uh, learning on the job or that you also. Uh, seek out particular like courses online, um, um, to, to fill in some, some gaps in your knowledge, </p><p>Elise: [00:04:59] a bit of both. Um, I think that there's no substitute for learning on the job. I think that's the best way to learn. Um, and certainly in my experience, I learned much better through having an actual project to follow rather than, um, sitting down and doing a course and answering questions.</p><p>Um, although I have, I have done that, I've done sort of all of the Google analytics, um, certifications, um, I'm sort of looking at copywriting courses. Uh, I've had lots of conversations with SEO experts. So not necessarily a course, but like building up that network of people you can go to and ask questions.</p><p>Guido: [00:05:33] That really depends on the, on the course, how hands on they are. Of course, some do have projects anymore. Uh, working together included, but yes, there are also a lot of those courses. Of course, it's, like I said, just filling in a form or a to get your certificate throne. </p><p>Elise: [00:05:49] Yeah. It, it feels like a box ticking exercise.</p><p>And for me, I don't, I don't learn through box-ticking I learned through doing, um, but everyone, everyone is different. Right. So some people are much better having a structured course to follow. Um, I had to train a guy how to code, um, About a year ago and, you know, everything I taught him was useful, but then he was like, I really want to do a structured course because that's the best way that he learns.</p><p>So he went off and did a structured, a JavaScript course and came back with this immense amount of knowledge, um, which is like really, really helped him out over the last year or so in the role that he's, he's working. </p><p>Guido: [00:06:24] And they also are also really juice enjoyed, uh, the combination as in, um, I want to get those that handle, uh, experience, but also.</p><p>I would prefer to skip the first couple of months of failing. Yeah. As, as much as possible. So a couple of hours, uh, of a course to help me get started and to at least avoid the biggest mistakes that would be </p><p>Elise: [00:06:51] well, you can't, you can't avoid failing. You can't work in CRO and avoid failing. I'm really sorry to break on to you.</p><p>Um, but no, you're, you're completely right. And I often find with, um, especially paid courses, uh, you never really know what you're going to get. Um, they kind of give you all this sales spiel and you're like, Oh no, that sounds great. And then you sit there for the first couple of hours and go, well, I already knew all of this or you go, this is way over my head.</p><p>What have I let myself in for? Yeah. So finding the right course can be so, so tricky. Um, which again is part of the reason why I much prefer learning on the job. It's partly reason why I love working for SMEs because a lot of the time. Something is thrown at me and I go, do you know what? I don't know the answer to that, but I'm going to go look it up.</p><p>And I'm going to speak to my network and find someone that knows the answer and I'll come back to you. And I've learned something in the process of doing that. Um, but again, that's just me. That's, that's how I learn </p><p>Guido: [00:07:45] best for over 10 years now, online dot look at Pfizer's about evidence-based version ultimization with a focus on data and psychology.</p><p>We see that analyzing data and recognizing customer behavior results in a better online dialogue with your clients and a higher ROI. The team of strategists, analysts, psychologists, and UX specialists gathered valuable insights in the online behavior of your visitors. And together with you optimize, if the elements of your zero program through redesigned expert reviews, AB test and behavioral analysis, for more information about their services.</p><p>Go to online dialogue. Speaking of gaining skills, uh, the point to where we're sitting together, uh, today is you, you wrote a blog post, uh, about chiro soft skills. Um, so first of all, why did you, uh, write the book? </p><p>Elise: [00:08:35] It started off about a year or so ago. I'd landed a contract and, um, And there was some big communication issues with one of the stakeholders.</p><p>Um, and I sort of sat there and I spoke to some of my peers and the people I was working with. And I was saying, why are we struggling to explain to him what CRO is? Why are we struggling to get him to sign off on any experiments that we want to run? What's the, what's the problem here. Um, and it turns out that he was a really visual learner.</p><p>Um, he didn't, he didn't have the, um, the brains that thought in analytical ways, he couldn't look at data and go, Oh, okay. That's a problem. Um, she couldn't, he couldn't read an email or read a hypothesis and understand that that was a problem. And this was the concept that we wanted to experiment to see if we could improve the problem.</p><p>So, yeah, we, we worked out, he was really visual. So off the back of this contract, which had been really frustrating for a good couple of weeks, trying to. Understand what he wasn't getting. It was just a communication issue. Like he couldn't, he couldn't understand the way I was communicating to him. Yeah.</p><p>As soon as I, since I had this brainwave of, Oh, he's visual, he needs to see wire frames or he needs to have a mock up of something, which isn't the best process to have. But when you're trying to educate someone around the AB testing process, um, Just to begin with then having a visual and sort of doing that extra piece of work at the beginning of, of a test process really, really helps in the long run.</p><p>Um, after just had this brainwave, why somebody thought, Oh my God, I had a stakeholder a couple of years ago. Who I was having the same issue with and we would butt heads all the time. And it's probably because of my methods. My preferred method of communication was not the same as his preferred method of communication.</p><p>He couldn't absorb the information. Um, and then that kind of trailed back to a story that I frequently tell, um, from my university days I have, um, I have a really close friend. I'm still really good friends with him who, um, is not dyslexic, but he. It's really struggles to absorb information through reading and writing.</p><p>Um, that's just not his preferred method of communication. He, um, he's very audible, so he's very chatty, um, understood things better when he was sat in a lecture and could listen to the information, but that meant that he really, really struggled to write and submit his essays on time. Whereas I'm much more of a written communicator.</p><p>Um, I know I'm speaking right now to you on a podcast. Um, but I, this has taken the years of practice for me to sort of get better at communicating, um, audibly and linguistically, um, as opposed to writing stuff, which is part of the reason why I wrote a blog post. Yeah, exactly. Um, so I kind of worked out the system with my friend.</p><p>Where he would dictate his essays to me. And then I would sit there and I would write them. Um, and the irony is like, I kind of do the same thing with my now husband, uh, quite a lot where he will, he works for startups. Um, and he's heavily invested in one particular startup right now. And, you know, he'll, he'll kind of have this idea and really struggled to.</p><p>To articulate, um, what he wants the messaging to convey. So we'll, we'll literally sit there or go for a walk and we'll have a chat and then I can sit there and write down copy for him. And so I think this is what you were trying to trying to say, essentially. Um, so the whole idea of the CRO soft skills was off the back of this is experience that I had with a contract.</p><p>And then when I thought about it, I thought, actually, this goes way back. These methods of communication and preferences go way back in my life. Um, I have all of these examples to draw on. I want to draw more attention to it. Um, and that's kind of how I came across this whole idea of CRA soft skills. </p><p>Guido: [00:12:28] Well, so let's go, uh, go through them.</p><p>You you've written down, uh, six of them. Is there like any particular order or hokey in them or </p><p>Elise: [00:12:36] not? Not really. It's just how I wrote the article. And so I'm kind of happy to go in whatever order. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:12:41] So let's start with listening. Number one </p><p>Elise: [00:12:44] again, I feel like listening is, um, It's kind of like that key point to understand what someone's preferred communication style is.</p><p>Um, And I, in my article, I've split it into two. So there's the aspect of listening to your customers, especially when you're working in CRO, you know, your customers are the ones that are probably experiencing the problems. They're the ones whose experience you're trying to improve upon. So you should listen to what they have to say.</p><p>Um, I mean, I'm a big advocate for UX. I come from a developer background and I've been doing AB testing for longer than I've been doing UX, but the more I've I've done. UX the more, I'm a big advocate for it. And I think you can't really do UX without doing AB testing at the same time. I think the two go hand in hand, um, which is why listening is so important because you can understand why people are struggling to complete a particular action on your website or app.</p><p>Um, so that's why I think listening to your customers is really important, but I think that listening really extends into your colleagues as well, especially when it comes to trying to understand, you know, how best they communicate with you. So. Um, again, it could be that they have a test idea, um, but they don't really know how to explain to you their test idea.</p><p>Um, but if they've got an idea, then that's great. That means they're already engaged. You know, you don't have to necessarily educate them around, um, AB testing. Um, But, you know, you need to do something with that test, which means you need to listen to them in the first place. Um, if you're trying to work out what their preferred communication style is, listening is not necessarily having a conversation like we're doing right now, listening to, and also be reading.</p><p>They could have written you an email or, you know, send you a screenshot of another website that they've seen where they've gone. Oh, I really liked the design of this particular aspect on this website. That's their way of communicating. So you need to listen to that. And then try and communicate back in a similar style </p><p>Guido: [00:14:36] and, and, and try, um, try to get them to understand the, how AB testing work.</p><p>Right. I think that's where a lot of people. Also struggle with, with people coming through. Okay. I wanted to do an AB test on this, a new landing page that we made, but okay. It's a new landing page. Is it live yet? No. So there's no perfect. Now can you please meet us at, uh, </p><p>Elise: [00:14:57] yeah, exactly. Um, but yeah, so I think that listening is kind of like that first, the first port of call, really, to understand, you know, both in terms of how you can improve things, um, for customers.</p><p>But also how you can improve your relationships with your colleagues as well, by understanding where they are in terms of understanding CRO, um, in terms of building that relationship and understanding how they communicate best visual or audibly or. Um, written, um, depending on how they've reached out to you in the first place.</p><p>Um, and also just kind of listening their concerns because you'll always come across a couple of colleagues who, you know, have major issues around testing and think it's a massive issue in terms of risk. Um, In which case if you've listened to their concerns properly and taken the time to not immediately get defensive around why we all know that testing is the least risky.</p><p>Um, you can take really when you're launching a new product or a new feature, but if you can listen to their concerns and it means that you can communicate the reasons why they're wrong back to them. Yeah. Um, but if you just talk over them or get defensive straight away, then you're never gonna. Have a proper conversation and you're continually going to, yeah, I agree.</p><p>Guido: [00:16:16] Argue with that, especially when you begin, uh, that a company that's, you're always new to them that I think like 30 or 40% of your time should probably go into internal communication to explain what you're doing and get them to understand how things work and </p><p>Elise: [00:16:32] completely, and I guess. Part of where my experience comes in because I am a contractor.</p><p>So I tend to change jobs every three to six months and go into a new business and have to go through this process. Um, from this whole soft skills is probably more relevant to people that do chop and change jobs a little more frequently than someone who is sort of set in, you know, a company like Amazon or booking.com where, you know, testing is already ingrained.</p><p>So, um, but those relationships are still really important to build. And I think listening is, is. The first step to that. Um, I also think it can be applied to your personal relationships as well. Like a lot of people just tend to talk over each other. Um, and we don't listen to each other enough, really, </p><p>Guido: [00:17:13] so more and more are listening for four year olds.</p><p>So the second point is communicating. I think we've. All right. I'll touch on that in the intro and just a bit, but, uh, any more tips on communicating? </p><p>Elise: [00:17:24] I'm not sure. I mean, again, it really depends on who you're communicating with. Obviously stakeholders are going to be vital for getting sign off, in which case, working out.</p><p>How that particular stakeholder prefers to communicate is going to be really important. Um, but then also if you're working with engineers, for example, some engineers are not, um, people, persons at all, you know, they, they like being behind their screen. In which case you can almost. Automatically assume that grabbing them for a coffee, um, or, you know, having a video chat like this and these particular circumstances, um, is not going to be the best way to communicate.</p><p>So you need to make sure that you're writing emails, which. Contain all of the details that they need, </p><p>Guido: [00:18:09] do them through JIRA tickets or, or get comments, </p><p>Elise: [00:18:12] right. That's exactly it. Exactly it, and be succinct as well. Like don't, don't ramble on. Um, I was, uh, I was actually having a conversation with, um, some colleagues two days ago around the European style of communicating versus the British style.</p><p>Um, And in Britain, we're very kind of, Hey, how are you? How was your week? Um, whereas, uh, in my experience, you correct me if I'm wrong. Um, I love the European style of just, you know, hi, this is what I need. Yesterday's brainstorm was so good. I really liked step's idea of running that test on the call to action buttons, making them orange will really make them stand out.</p><p>Don't you think? </p><p>Guido: [00:18:52] Yeah, right. We want to design real AB test winners and achieve enormous conversion uplift. Then stop, brainstorming, and take a scientific approach. If you can read Dutch follow the steps that online influence the bestseller or even book Dalton out and rule in the office course and become an expert in applying proven behavioral signs yourself.</p><p>Go to &nbsp;dot com for more information and free notes. I remember working for 'em or hearing a story. Uh, it happened before I joined the company, but they, there was a Swedish company and they took over a company in the UK and they were quite offended by the sweets just saying hi, and, uh, and this and this, and this is what I need while the UK will prefer saying, Hey, hello, how are you?</p><p>Elise: [00:19:39] Yeah, they do. Do we do all of the niceties? I actually much prefer the European style. I'm like, no, no, no, this is what I need from you. This is what I'm telling you. Just get on with it. You know, I'll catch up with you at the pub or, you know, we'll have drinks on a Friday or whatever, and then I'll make nice.</p><p>But right now I need, I need to do work. I need to get stuff done. Exactly. </p><p>Guido: [00:19:59] So, so what I'm hearing is, is, is mainly beef be flexible in how you communicate. This is not a one size fits all. I really tailor it to the person or a group of people that you are a communicator. </p><p>Elise: [00:20:09] Exactly. That's exactly it. Um, and don't get me wrong.</p><p>It's not easy at all. Like I said, I'm, I'm much more of a, a writer and a reader than I am a talker. Um, this is something I've had to work on over the last couple of years. You know, the first time I gave a presentation, I, I was so nervous. I was so scared. Um, But if everything went fine, you know, and I was presenting to absorb the information.</p><p>If they didn't absorb the information, then I made sure I sent a nice email at the end, with a followup to explain why covered. Um, you're completely right. Being flexible in your communication styles. I think. It's really, really key. </p><p>Guido: [00:20:45] I actually heard a, saw a comment from someone on a, on LinkedIn or post actually from someone that said, uh, that he has been, uh, working as, as off to, to, to actually tailor the communication, uh, to this.</p><p>This was specifically. Uh, about the results of experiments and sharing that with the company. And he stated that previously that's, uh, to the specific group person that he was communicating with anything that, well, last week I changed it, I just sent one template to everyone and no one complains. So my, my first comment was.</p><p>Are you sure that the people are reading? I don't want to, I don't want to be an asshole, but is anyone reading it? </p><p>Elise: [00:21:26] Yeah, you're completely right. And it could be that no one complained because you know, they looked at it and went, Oh, I don't, I don't really understand it, you know? And they didn't want to ask the question.</p><p>Um, which again, I think is where that communication style really opens up those relationships. If you've already proven yourself to be open to communicating. In the way that the other person prefers. If you're already listening to them and actively listening to them, then they will feel more open to and approach you with test ideas or with questions.</p><p>Um, that's, that's the thing I love most about my job is when people come and ask me questions, because I know that they're engaged. Yeah. I know that I've already to build that relationship. If no, one's asking me questions, I'm thinking, what have I done wrong? Um, what, what are they not getting? Because.</p><p>Nope, no one understands everything. I tell them the first time around, I wouldn't expect them to, you know, I've got sort of almost eight years experience working in CRO. I wouldn't expect to be able to convey eight years worth of experience to a person in an hour's presentation. I would expect them to come to me with questions and if they don't have questions, then I've done something wrong.</p><p>Guido: [00:22:32] Well, what I usually try to do when I'm there, there's usually a, of course, some communication going on between different departments and Shiro. It's often situated within digital marketing. Uh, but you might have communication with, uh, sales or with, uh, customer success or customer service or whatever the name is.</p><p>And usually those departments have different goals than your department. Uh, so it really helps to get an understanding what it is, is the goal of the service department or the sales department. What are their KPIs for, for this quarter or this year, if you can frame your results, uh, in those KPIs in, in that context for them.</p><p>Uh, it makes much more sense than when you just send them a report. Okay. We increase the KPIs for eCommerce, but yeah, they don't. </p><p>Elise: [00:23:20] Yeah. Yeah. And that might not be relevant to them. </p><p>Guido: [00:23:22] It's not their KPIs. </p><p>Elise: [00:23:24] It's really interesting. You bring that up while you actually also wrote an article on where CRO should sit.</p><p>Um, and I think, again, this is why communication is so important because I've seen CRO. Sits within their own team. So sort of completely dedicated. Yeah. I've seen them sit in analytics, product marketing engineering. And the hard thing about working in CRO is that you have to have relationships with people from all of those teams.</p><p>It doesn't matter where the CRO team or person is positioned within a business hierarchy. It doesn't matter at all. What matters is that that person or team has a relationship with all of these other teams? Because everything overlaps and </p><p>Guido: [00:24:03] it matters in the end of the, at the end of the year, when you need to explain your KPIs and then it really matters which departments you fall.</p><p>Elise: [00:24:12] Yeah. No, that is true. I mean, who's, who's budget the paycheck coming out for sure. But from, from like a relationship point of view and from a soft skills point of view. Yeah. I don't think it doesn't matter at all. It's it's about those relationships that you build. Um, As, as a CRO specialist. </p><p>Guido: [00:24:29] Yeah, it's funny.</p><p>I, um, uh, I often feel more, most comfortable if it's, if it falls within product, uh, somehow. Um, and then I was also talking to a company, uh, last week and they were looking for, um, uh, growth product lead and. Uh, they had no ID. Why Sierra would be relevant there. </p><p>Elise: [00:24:53] Oh, dear. </p><p>Guido: [00:24:54] I'm like, but that's okay. I think if I'm reading the job description that they had for it, there was exactly, it sounded like CRO.</p><p>It sounded like, but just because it was not onsite on the website, they thought it was completely irrelevant. Oh gosh. That's weird to, uh, to, to have those conversations and then you. Um, experienced that the communication or, or the, the knowledge gap that there can be at some companies. </p><p>Elise: [00:25:20] Yeah, definitely.</p><p>And then obviously someone goes in and. Shows them the importance of CRO and product and that relationship. And they go, gosh, we totally missed the boat on that. We've got like completely. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:25:30] Yeah. But they, they even got the experimentation in there, so I'm like, okay. But it's very similar. </p><p>Elise: [00:25:37] Oh, wow. </p><p>Guido: [00:25:37] So let's, let's go through to your, uh, third point, which is being, </p><p>Elise: [00:25:43] yeah.</p><p>I'm actually talking about product. This works in quite well. Um, cause uh, obviously a lot of, a lot of products, um, Product manager's job is, uh, managing essentially we all manage it sort of the process of a product being researched and developed and built. Um, and I think CRO does also require a substantial amount of organizational skills as well.</p><p>Um, Not, maybe not quite to the same level as, as project or product manager. Um, I've, I've done some project management in, in my past and I have a big props, lots of respects to project managers. Um, it's not for me. Uh, I'm very much a, um, I like being active. I like producing things and creating things myself.</p><p>Um, and I find that with project management, there's an awful lot of chasing other people. To do stuff, uh, which I, I sometimes get a bit frustrated with. So </p><p>Guido: [00:26:36] it's basically the job. Yeah. </p><p>Elise: [00:26:38] Yeah. So I have a lot of respect for the people that do project management. Um, for sure, but with CRA I, I believe that you still need to be very organized.</p><p>Um, In order to just to manage any kind of CRO or experimentation roadmap. And even if you're working within a team, um, and maybe you're not in charge of the full sale roadmap because things change and it's the so quickly within experimentation. Um, You know, you might be working on, you might be focusing on UX and doing some research into one part of a website, as well as, you know, another part of a website and trying to submit results, or like do some analysis that requires a certain level of organization to understand what you need to prioritize and what you need to report on first and where your time should be spent.</p><p>Guido: [00:27:23] So, so how do you do this when you, when you start at a company? Uh, you said you often come in as the first one, uh, breaking over for new eight, four, four news, zero people a to B and then get them, uh, up and running. But, uh, even though there's a blank slate, uh, zero wise or experimentation wise, There are real, already structures in place.</p><p>They might already be using a JIRA or Trello or Google sheets. So how do you get started? How do you, uh, get them, uh, on board with using, uh, documentation? </p><p>Elise: [00:27:58] It's a really good question. And actually mentioning all of those tools is key. I, I prefer to try and use a tool that they're already familiar with. Um, you know, if part of the team already using JIRA, then I'll be flexible and turn around and say, yep.</p><p>Okay. We can. You can stick all of our AB tests in the backlog, into JIRA and we'll have a JIRA. Right. Um, or, you know, if, if they're using Trello then fine. If there's nothing in place at all, then I might simply start with a Google sheets because it's less overwhelming for them to learn a brand new tool and a new process.</p><p>If all they have to do is look at what is essentially an Excel spreadsheet. You know, most people are familiar with that. Um, And in terms of kind of getting that organization, that process in place, a lot of that has to do with the education piece when you're first trying to get everyone up to speed with what AB testing is.</p><p>Um, Part of that is talking about the process. You know, you need to have a backlog of ideas, need to be evidence-based in is prioritize them and decide what you're going to run fast. And then ideally you want to put together a roadmap, um, so that you know what you're going to be running and what you're going to be running lost in the news reporting on it.</p><p>So, and I think all of this plays into being organized is them understanding what. What process should roughly look like? Um, and there's no perfect process, right? You know, every business has something slightly different that works for them. And that doesn't, but starting off with the basics there's is a good way to start.</p><p>I think </p><p>Guido: [00:29:23] marketing mergers have suffered and the sheriff AB testing has been impacted too. If you want to keep testing to enterprise standards, but save 80% on your annual contract, you can consider it. Oh, fertile to go, but there's summer release. You can take advantage of full stack and hybrid features, strong privacy compliance, no blink and enterprise.</p><p>Great security. Feel good about your smart business decision infest, what you save, backing your CRO program. Check out www adults over the phone slash 2020. Yeah, reusing the, or utilizing the tools that they already have. Uh, I think that's, that's definitely always my strategy because the hardest part is getting people to switch tools.</p><p>So, and it really depends on their maturity. And if you're just starting out, it doesn't make sense to, um, uh, to introduce a new tool, uh, unless they're, they're really, uh, bought into the whole idea. And everyone wants to, uh, has the time. Weekly or maybe even daily to use such a tool and get familiar with it.</p><p>Does it make sense to, to start learning a new tool? I love using like effective experiments. I really love the tool. Uh, it really takes away a lot of the communication you need to do as a, as a CRO, a manager, uh, getting everyone on board. It just does that for you. But if no one is using the tool, because they're not familiar with it, they find it too complicated.</p><p>Everyone's in, in, in JIRA or trout all day. Anyway. Uh, it's, it's really hard to make people. Change in general, but </p><p>Elise: [00:30:59] definitely no, I'd completely agree. I really like effective experiments as well, but most of the time I go in as, as a one woman band. And, you know, if I try and force a tool like that on a team, a lot of the time they kind of go, but we don't.</p><p>We're not redoing the CRO. You're here to do the CRO and then we're going to have a replacement come in to take over from you. Um, we don't want a whole new tool, you know, we'd much rather everything connected up. We're using JIRA and our engineers are using JIRA. Then that means all of the engineers conceived documentation.</p><p>And it's sometimes </p><p>Guido: [00:31:32] perfect. Of course. I'm I get really frustrated with JIRA though. Brett two effects. I wish for effective experiments daily F I use for that. But, uh, yeah. Then the, then the frustration is it's something you need to take in for at least, uh, um, the start of such a, </p><p>Elise: [00:31:48] yeah. I feel like if you force the tool upon someone or if you.</p><p>Really try and force a very strict process upon a company. Then they're never going to continue. They're never going to carry on with it. The whole thing will be a failure. Um, you really need to try and work with what they're familiar with and try and understand what is accomplishable. Um, within that particular business is it's very much a per business or per company.</p><p>Um, Situation really. </p><p>Guido: [00:32:15] And it's a particular, um, uh, tips for your mind to have to organize the results of experiments. </p><p>Elise: [00:32:21] Keep everything together if possible. So for example, if you're using something like JIRA or Trello, um, then make sure that your. Putting all of the results, even if it's a slide deck, a lot of my results, I tend to put into, um, a presentation slide.</p><p>Uh, so that again, I can address the different communication styles where I can write out a paragraph. This is the results I can also graph, and I can include a screenshot of what was tested. Um, So it's nice and nice and accommodating for all those different communication styles, but I make sure that that goes in with the Gera ticket.</p><p>I'm also, I'm a big fan of numbering, all of your experiments, um, sort of in the backlog, in whatever, uh, Organizational tool you're using making sure you've got like that. And then whatever testing tool you're using, make sure that the number is the same across all of those experiments. Um, it's quite fun.</p><p>Now I'm working with some teams to sort of turn around and go, well, how are you getting on with, you know, CRO 67. Um, and we all know what we're talking about in fact, but one of the companies I used to work for, we had an ongoing tickets, uh, which was within our, um, Within our JIRA board for all of the experimentation we were running and it was something like, it was something like CRO one, two, three, and we'd have stand up every week.</p><p>And we'd say, Oh, Sam how's CRH one, two, three, coming on. It had nothing to do with testing. It was trying to get him to quit smoking. Um, so it meant we didn't have to ask him how he's getting on we're quitting smoking. We just get how CRA one, two, three, um, see if it. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. He'd always say it was blocked.</p><p>It's blocked right now. </p><p>Guido: [00:33:58] Nice. So we, we need to listen. We need to communicate. We need to stay organized. Uh, and we also need to be flexible. Uh, so what do you mean? </p><p>Elise: [00:34:08] I mean, we've talked, we've used the word flexible quite a lot in everything we've already covered. So being flexible around communication styles, being flexible around what tools and processes you try and put into a company.</p><p>Um, But I also moved flexible in the sense that, you know, we've just talked about putting together a roadmap and putting together a plan for testing. Um, however plan, like things never go to plan, right? I'm I'm seven months pregnant and I'm being told to put together a birth plan, knowing full well that.</p><p>That probably won't happen. It won't go according to plan. Um, it's yeah, it's fine. I'm going to have to be flexible about it. Um, I do the same thing with, with my roadmaps, with my experimentations. You've gotta be flexible because, </p><p>Guido: [00:34:48] but you have to have a baseline. </p><p>Elise: [00:34:50] Yes. Yeah. It seems good to have a plan. So you've got, you know, roughly what you want to accomplish, but business requirements change last minute campaigns suddenly come up because someone forgot to tell you that this was happening.</p><p>Um, you know, we have, uh, twice weekly releases where the website might change something which might affect the test that's that's running. Um, the whole idea is that you almost need to plan for those instructions. Now, um, a lot of my testing roadmaps do tend to include a little bit of. A breathing space almost, uh, for those last minute things that can come up.</p><p>So there's that aspect of flexibility in terms of the actual running of experiments. Um, but again, I think it's also about being flexible with colleagues around test hypotheses that they might have come up with and you sit down and you have a chat with them, and you realize that that hypothesis is complete nonsense maybe, but you can see where they've come from.</p><p>With the idea or with the problem. So you need to be a bit flexible in terms of getting them to think about it in a different way, or, you know, rewriting or reworking that hypothesis, or thinking a bit more around what their KPIs are. </p><p>Guido: [00:35:58] That's, that's a, that's a struggle in the beginning, right? If you start out and they are enthusiastic, but come to you with stuff you think, well, no, but you do want to give them enthusiastic about it.</p><p>You do want to get them. Keep that man full in all of this. So like you just said, you don't want to put them down right away and demotivate them. So there's a fine balance. </p><p>Elise: [00:36:21] It's a really difficult line to draw because you don't want to you're right. You don't want to turn around and say, no, that's, that's not gonna work.</p><p>Um, cause you do want to keep them engaged, which is why, again, it comes back to listening. You need to listen to them and understand how they've come across this particular hypothesis so that you can then sit down and go, alright, I understand that. That's the problem that you've witnessed. Maybe you've seen a user recording or your mum spoke to you at the weekend and said, Oh, I think you could improve the website by doing this.</p><p>You know, that's someone who's experienced a problem, but we need a bit more evidence or we need to work out how we can actually, um, measure that. The thing that we're changing has improved, um, You know, it's, it's around being flexible with a colleague to try and encourage them to think a bit differently about the hypothesis.</p><p>They've come to </p><p>Guido: [00:37:11] the skill. I need to work on that. Not necessarily in a situation where, uh, starting a new company and introducing people to Shiro, but I do often very often feel like the bath cope at meetings where people talk about numbers in analytics or not necessarily experiments. And I'm like, Uh, that that's not what those numbers mean.</p><p>Uh, th th there are a lot of conclusions drawn and then there's me the only one being in the room saying, well, </p><p>Elise: [00:37:38] yeah, yeah, but I mean, there's, again, there's a really fine line between, especially when you're looking at things like data where, uh, it can be interpreted in certain ways. And I think we'll probably cover this a little bit later, but, um, You don't want to fudge the numbers, you know, that there's still a right way and a wrong way.</p><p>Um, and if what they're doing is wrong or completely out there, then, um, you, you don't need to be fixed. He can turn around and go. We'll actually, you know, we have this evidence and all of that, this experience to say that what you're telling me is incorrect, um, which isn't necessarily. Flexible. Um, in fact it's the opposite of being flexible, but you need to understand you're needing to sort of work on when is the best time to be flexible.</p><p>And when you should </p><p>Guido: [00:38:21] fights back office a worldwide unique AB testing, personalization and product recommendation solution. So I spread the works to service sites without any tags or scripts, which guarantees an ultimate performance, the SiteSpect solution eliminates delays and the chance of any flickering effects.</p><p>And this approach also ensures that the current and future browser skirts your rules like ITP and don't make an impact on your AB testing and personalization with more info visit &nbsp;dot com. Yeah. For example, that when people are. Uh, either really sad or really happy with the results from a, from a certain day or we, we score 10% of the ball, uh, budget or attempts and below budget, and there's really good or really bad and like, okay.</p><p>But your standard deviation is like 50 bucks. </p><p>Elise: [00:39:12] Yeah, yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:39:13] Or maybe even 5%, but still within the range of expected things. So it's not necessarily. Yeah. </p><p>Elise: [00:39:21] Why, why are you celebrating? Like, no, just celebrate right now. </p><p>Guido: [00:39:24] Yeah. Or it can also be positive, right? So you don't have to feel bad. It's not exceptionally bad.</p><p>It's just 10% less than expected, but it's within the expected range. </p><p>Elise: [00:39:34] It's within the expected range. Let's see what happens over the next couple of days, but yeah, flexibility. I think, um, I think I also mentioned in my article around, obviously I used to be a developer. Um, so. Knowing what can, and can't be tested.</p><p>Uh, sometimes someone might come to you with this great idea and you're like, Oh, that's, that's fantastic. And then you sit down and you start to develop it, or you start to code it or T shirt size it, Nicole, actually, uh, it's, it's not technically possible for us to do that. So you have to be a bit flexible in the term in the sense of how do we make this test work?</p><p>Because we could still have a lot of learnings. I think that's where, um, things like fake door test come in, where you, um, You sort of create a link to a new feature, which doesn't actually exist yet. Um, and you kind of go, well, we don't have the capacity or we can't build out the whole feature right now.</p><p>We just want to see if it's, if it's viable or not. Um, that's a good way to be flexible in terms of actually building experiments. </p><p>Guido: [00:40:30] Do you want on the subscription to our surface click here and then, Oh, we haven't built this yet, but, um, yeah. Great to know your interested. </p><p>Elise: [00:40:37] Exactly. Exactly. That's that's a good way to be flexible.</p><p>I think </p><p>Guido: [00:40:40] number five, I think that this is almost a, at the, at the core of, of being a CRO, a practitioner is being curious. </p><p>Elise: [00:40:47] Yeah, for sure.

And we'll be doing that together with Tiro specialists, Armani of law from the UK. </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:00:20] My name is Kelly ulcer and welcome </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:00:22] to Shiro cafe. The podcast where I show you the behind the scenes of optimization teams and talk with their specialists about data and human driven, optimum, and implementing a culture of experimentation and validation in case you missed it.</p><p>In the previous English episode, I spoke with Yogi girl. Yes. AB testing statistics. And you can listen to that episode on the shearography website or in the book best active listing with right now, this episode of shearography is made possible by our partners. Find spec all on influence Institute square and all my dialogue.</p><p>Welcome to season two, episode 31, a warm welcome to the cafe. And can you give us a short introduction of your journey into Syria? </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:01:04] So I actually started off in direct marketing, 13 years ago now. and we used a lot of the same principles in CRO. And then in terms of data analysis, in terms of testing EMR campaigns, testing direct mail campaigns.</p><p>So it was a natural evolution for me to move to digital. And so about eight years ago, maybe moved to digital, started doing but analytics then obviously . insights and insights led to how can we improve the user experience? And so then I became a CRO about the same time as well. I think that actually my first day doing web analytics, my first project was a CRL project for a large cosmetic surgery company.</p><p>And, so yeah, that kind of got the, got me into it and. Funny enough. That very first project was, was my biggest, one of my biggest results to date. I think it was like 420% uplift in the main conversion rate of the page. So yeah, that got me hooked. I was like, Oh great. And, chasing those triple digit puppets, but they are few and far between I've come to find a, it's usually 5%.</p><p>rather than, 400% </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:18] and your rights are how no one has actually done a study in CRO or, but it'd be, we all have different backgrounds, and end up doing experiments. </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:02:28] Yes exactly. I always say to people here now landed in my dream job. Cause my favorite thing when I was in school was science and my favorite part science was running experiments.</p><p>Cause I love Jenna you'd have an idea. You test out. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it didn't, you always learn so big at the end of it. And so then, now I get to do this. And no one pays me to do it. So I'm like, if all I could, if all I could do is come up with ideas, run experiments, or there I'd be very happy.</p><p>but unfortunately there's, so there's a lot of other things that come along with working in organizations. You don't just get to play with experimentation all day long. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:04] So w what kind of work do you do right now? What are you working on? </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:03:07] currently, so I'm a consultant, so typically I will come in work for a company from anywhere.</p><p>Three months to about nine months, sometimes shorter, sometimes a bit longer. come in. Basically say, this is where your current, experimentation program is. This is where you want to be. How do we get there? And that might be a new post, a series of skinning, the staff, new tools, new ways of working, while it takes currently, I'm working for a notch, electronics distributor, one of the largest in the world, I think in a billion.</p><p>Dollar turnover annually and very large owned by an even bigger group based out of the U S is about 20 billion in turnover. So yes, it's probably the largest eCommerce tire work group today, 43 countries and, millions of visits a day. Very large B to B commerce, which is not one I've done a whole lot of previously.</p><p>So that's been a little bit of a learning curve also as well as, really electrical engineering products and our multimeters and instead of scopes and, a, And I know about fashion products working on fashion sites that are about domestic steam, as well as by using consumable sites.</p><p>But I don't, I'm not an electrical engineer. I don't not, I don't know one more to meet promoter. I don't own a set of scope from motivator, et cetera, I think wants to do with voltages. But, so it's yeah, it's hard to optimize a product, nothing about the challenge. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:04:41] Was he often come in with teams, dads don't do any experimentation at all.</p><p>I want to start with it or is it more like improving teams that are already. Experimenting with getting stuck somehow. </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:04:53] Yeah. So she used the teams that are already doing thumb experimentation, but they, they want to grow faster. They want to do more experiments, more wins. They want bigger wins. I've done a few where they've do zero experimentation and.</p><p>I think the time lag between, I think they think you can start, as I mentioned tomorrow, what is that? no, you've got to get the tool. You've got to get all the data, You've got to get all your tracking and panting, Because how are you going to measure everything? how are you going to optimize it?</p><p>The, you can't mention it. yeah. There's so much work that goes into it. And you could be there six months or say, Malware, registrar testing, because you've got the data in the store, you've got all your trucks, you've got a tool that works or you think it should work. And you've got the necessary skills in house to actually build test, because if you haven't outsourced everything, then that's probably an equally.</p><p>Either. And if, relying on a consultant is only going to be there for a few months, then what happens when you go, who's going to take over the reigns and a lot of the time I've, you go away, you come back and check on them again later. They're like, what happened? Oh, we had no one to look after it, so we didn't do it.</p><p>It just didn't really work for us. It didn't work because we didn't carry on. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:02] I wonder, do you, why do people hire you? So what's their initial reason of hiring you and then. And then second step. I can part of the question, when you started working for them, what's actually the bottleneck. what do you find was actually the issue that they are, that they're struggling?</p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:06:20] I think people ha CRO same as the higher STRP for SEO people. They want more traffic. Yeah, people, they want more revenue from that traffic and that's essentially it. They wanted a better conversion rate. we're converting at 3%. We want 5%, current, 5% are going to be compared to 10. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:37] So you say just fire your SEO person and your conversion will go up less.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:06:43] I've actually started, if all you cared about and it was a conversion rate, that was that right. Let's exclude all the bounced visits. There you go. That's 50% increase. There you go. That's simple way to do it. but yeah, so it's revenue, it tends to be, they want you to increase the revenue.</p><p>it's different client clients. Some clients are, I want my year on year revenue to be increased. I want my profitability to be increased. I want, and it depends what they're trying to detach. Cause you know of the situation where someone's. God business that we wouldn't get for a few years, they're looking to sell and retire to which case they needed to make as much revenue as possible.</p><p>They don't really care about profit. They're like, great. we'll do incentivization and we'll do discounting. We'll do everything we can do to drive as much stuff as possible. But the books and the companies are like, you know what? This can be. The side business that I wanted to be my full time business.</p><p>I needed to make profit as much as possible. So it's a, it's very different, but yeah, it's at the end of the day, it tends to be, they want more money in one shape or another. I think the biggest bottleneck for a lot of organizations is, they've heard the term, they know it's about running experiments, but they don't how'd you get started, they've tried maybe changing the button, color changing image, and you're like, Oh, it didn't work.</p><p>I think happened Cause. Yeah, you're just testing random things. You don't have a hypothesis, you don't have any data. You don't have UX, you don't have user research. All you've got is a tool and George's changing things around them and, cross your fingers. Now, the best words, AB testing CRO is follows.</p><p>The scientific presence for is that you need to have. A theory that you are testing out. If the test doesn't work, then that showed you that theory is incorrect. So there's a, either a gap in your knowledge, or you've disproved as something works at some point, you know what? It should be orange. Okay. You tested it out.</p><p>It didn't work. you proved that you're watching, shouldn't be orange. You can say that. And having the best color of your buttons is no, you haven't. so I think there's that the biggest gap I sent is that the users, who wants to start optimizing. They just don't know where to start on how to do it, Don now the best way to do it.</p><p>they lacked probably some of the rigor that they should be when they're running tests or, all the bad stuff we know about stopping tests early, not having enough sample size, not having enough conversions. And yeah, it's a learning curve. It's a massive learning curve to get them skilled, to understand, why you follow this best practice.</p><p>Why do you. That's how things so rigidly, why do you say, look, this is 88%. Surely we could just leave it running for the week and more competency, but that's not what you do. And this is why you don't do that. so it's, I think that's the biggest bottleneck hide find is that it's a lack of knowledge first.</p><p>And then once you have the knowledge, it's the resource and students can build the test. Who's going to curate the tests. Who's going to analyze the results. he was going to implement the windows on my site. cause most times, the dev teams are already stretched to capacity and then you ask them to do additional work on top of what you're doing.</p><p>Ask the QA is to distal Dwayne of tests, which can, test can break things so easily when you inject your drops. so I think, yeah, to me, the two bottlenecks, the beginning is the knowledge gap. As it's going on. It's that resource to actually get things built to lie and liars implemented. That's for me, whether the two issues tend to be time and time.</p><p>Again, every organization I've been to </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:12] lack of process, or they have the tool, they know we have a tool, so it should work. I've just start randomly throwing stuff at the tool. And I hope something sticks, but unfortunately it doesn't work always </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:10:25] well in my work now. And it depends how bad the site is.</p><p>Cause sometimes you would come to a fire truck. Yeah. Yeah. It's such an fine start again. I can't optimize, I can't optimize it, but really just redesigned the whole thing care. There's a basic wire wireframe. Just put that library will guarantee you that will be what you've currently have, but those kind of guys are few and far between a lot of the times it's, they're, they've been testing for a while.</p><p>They might have hit the local maximum and it's we need to change the design because you've got 10 compete together. And so we're trying to be above the fold. that can't work. so you need to change the way their whole look and build the site is to, and incorporate your learnings.</p><p>And what is the most important thing to have that right </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:06] place marketing mergers have suffered. And the sheriff for AB testing has been impacted too, if you want to keep that thing to enterprise standards, but save 80% on your annual contract, you can consider it. Oh, fertile to go with their summer release.</p><p>You can take advantage of full stack and hybrid </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:11:24] features, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:25] strong privacy compliance, no blink </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:11:28] and </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:28] enterprise. Great </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:11:29] security. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:31] Feel good about your smart business decision infest. What you save, backing your CRO program. Check out www adult's over it. Let's go slash 2020, and you already mentioned the knowledge and skills.</p><p>And, so that's a nice segue into our main topic of today because there are a couple of weeks ago, you, you told me, or you mentioned that, that empathy is probably the most important skill for any CRO. So please enlighten us. </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:12:02] Yeah. So a lot of CRL people, I know like myself start stuff. as analytics, started off with data kind of mindset.</p><p>I read a article. I. Scientific paper that was released. I think it was 2012. Yes, 2012. And what they found was that by doing MRI scans and looking at people's brains, when they were using them perfect parts of the brains, the analytical parts are switched off and vice versa. You cannot do both at the same time.</p><p>You cannot be analytical. You cannot be empathetic, which is why things like, a conman. Can trick a smart person. He makes you empathize with him. Once you start empathizing with him, then your analytical reasoning goes out the window. So one challenge for reason goes out the window and you're like, Oh yes, I believe him.</p><p>But you have no reason to believe. Ms. Story is full of holes. It doesn't make any sense, but you're empathizing because you're empathizing is when you're over now as a CRO person. What you're trying to do is you're trying to. Convince the user to take an action that you would like them to do. So you need to be able to empathize with them.</p><p>Think what they're thinking, feel, what they're thinking, have an idea of the problems. Now. I'm not saying we should be con and trick people into doing stuff that is against the self-interest. No, obviously that'd be unethical. But what I'm saying is, yeah, we need to be able to think and feel like they do otherwise.</p><p>How can we try to steer them in what. Potentially the best for them and potentially what's best for the organization, your work. So this is why I think empathy is probably one of the strongest skills, but it is also one of the hardest ones to use because if you're constantly looking at data and you're constantly looking at user research and being quantitative and qualitative and they are, I understand why that is.</p><p>I see this distinct issue is a problem, distance that a problem statement, or, I can, I've got all this information great. But. How is that user actually feeling, what are their frustrations at each point? how does that actually feel? And there's a few little tricks that I've developed the chubby.</p><p>And one of the ones I always use is, when you are doing some analytical piece of work, don't try it to do your empathy part at the same time, take a break 20 minutes, come back and say, get all of that data. What is your as a theme and what is this group of users field? Why would they be seen in this?</p><p>why would they behave? So segwaying back to our previous conversation, the first project I had was for NCRO was for a cosmetic surgery company. And they asked me to look at their. Restful when patient services. And I was thinking, okay, looking at all the data and looking at what groups of pages are the best engagement.</p><p>And there was one set of pages that had far higher engagement than anything else. And that was the pages about where the hospitals were that did the search. And I thought to myself. that's strange. Why is that then? And then I started reading more about the company about, what made them different from their competitors.</p><p>And one of the key differentiators was that the fact that they had their own hospitals out across the country where you could go. And get your surgery done. And 90% of the UK population was in 30 minutes and I thought that's really important. if I was having surgery, regardless of BNI is cosmetic and actual, I wanted done hall just in case anything happens.</p><p>Family's close by. So come see me, et cetera. I'm not going to have to travel too far. So yes, it's really important job. these hospitals close to where you are. So the simple test I did was a little a call to action with a end of it, which had the little pins of all the hospitals. So people could see all of these are all across the country.</p><p>There's one right next to where I am. and we put that across the site, and this is the experiment that had led to it. A 400% increase. The user has actually gone to the signup page and inquiring about as much surgery and about a hundred percent increase in. He's is actually filling that format. So it wasn't just the next step that up, it was the whole journey and yeah, completely smashed out of the path, but it wouldn't have happened, if I can prevent that user, and that user process.</p><p>And the only way I did that was first time, the data then coming as they can. What does that data actually mean to the user? Why are they behaving? And I think that's why, if you don't have that empathy, he can't generate that for your user. you can burn all the numbers you like, but all you're going to get is what's happening, where it's happening and how often is happening.</p><p>You're never going to get to that. Why </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:43] what's your favorite, ways of gathering, the more qualitative side. of data on your users, on what they are getting stuck with. there's, this is a great example where you show people the information, whether it's really conscious or not, but the information that they want to know at that time, how close is it?</p><p>How far, or how far is it? so what are your favorite methods or tools to gather this data? </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:17:08] I love web analytics telling me where things are happening or what stuff new cause that really helps you to focus down because my example, I shot, I said previously, if I had not. Gone down and found the, those pages.</p><p>I couldn't find out, why is this happening? So I think that's what you gotta do is find some user behavior. That's different clients and segment and our set of pages that have much different. Yeah. Changes in KPIs to the rest of the site. Once you find that segment, that group of pages, that group of users, et cetera, then you need to go off and get that one.</p><p>So some of my favorite ones know recording in a scene app we're actually uses of doing on the site. I love heat maps to see where they're picking, where they, trying to click, but there is an active, and surveys are good if they're done correctly. But one, I think. The top one for me, the one I found always most helpful is moderated user testing, because you can access the users.</p><p>This is, why are you doing this? Why, how would you feel about this now? Why wouldn't this work? And I think once you've got all those bits of data, then it, all of those bits of information, and then you understand the feel and how they use it. Do you empathize with them then? It's also about looking at.</p><p>The compactors competitive research is one. I also love as well to find out, This is what the client is doing. This is what everyone else is. Where's the differentiator. How does that solve my user's problem? Once you can do that, you can use that in the news that, the way to use distinctive feeding, you can find out the areas that potentially are.</p><p>Separates you from the rest of them, then you can try to fix those years. Probably. yeah, I think. Main tools. I think ones that most people know about. And, but yeah, I think moderated user testing is probably the best one for me. I think it's just, especially, if you can get, your user profile really tight and you can find this exact type of user, I want, I've even had the case where now worked with a CIA C.</p><p>E O of a company. And he told me, no, this is not a problem. That's not why I use this camera. And then you're actually going to ask 10 users and they all say, yeah, I hate this. So on, this is a big issue for me. And then he was like, Okay. How do we fix this? and so there's no more trying to convince them because you're not just a consultant, but customers are telling these guys what's wrong.</p><p>And I think that's really powerful is when the customer is saying, Hey, your images, I can't see the, to the material on the model or, one of your competitors has video. I can see how the material so I can see is it going to be right for when I go out, my friends. so it's really powerful to get that information, get that in front of the people who make the decisions.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:53] Yeah. That's one of the most valuable things coming out of user research. those recorded the videos of frustrated users, combining those in one, one frustration video, and sending that to two managers. And, they quickly want to fix things. Yeah. So what we're talking about empathy, and, of course there's a in, most people are at least familiar with IQ, but there's also our EEQ.</p><p>So for the people amongst us, the more analysts that actually want to measure this is something we can measure all of our cells. We can there's, there are E Q tests out there. If you Google for those will, you, across a couple of them. We want to have more and more empathy, with the users, to improve our work.</p><p>So why do you think, or why, how can they, how can we, develop our empathy? How can we become better at this? </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:20:41] I think it's, the only way to empathize with your users, statute feel some of their frustrations. And I think one, the key thing that I always do is do what you use to do, but don't just do it once.</p><p>Do it 10, 20 times. I once had to find a intermittent tracking issue in the checkout. In both me actually going all the way through the checkout here in confirmation page and asked you that 20, 30 times, the one day, the things that weren't annoying me, five, 10 times were really good, maybe 20 or 30 times.</p><p>so then I was thinking, actually our users aren't as familiar with the website as I am. So what annoys me after 30 times is what annoys them after the first call. And that's when you quickly start taking tests. That's really bad. That's so annoying. I hate that. Why do I have to do this every time like that as you get used to the foibles of your website, because you have to enter the address in this way.</p><p>Otherwise it doesn't work. No. Why should that be like that? Why should you have to enter your postcode in without a rat spaces? Because every other website caters for it, not, you find tricks to make your website work after you've been using it for a number of. Days even, or weeks, but users you're coming there for the first time or users.</p><p>You don't use your website by 8,000 a day. And like you do aren't wherever all these tricks, aren't where all the different features and products, you try doing it the way they are doing it. So you use your, you just session recording to say, this is how they are entering in different products.</p><p>one item at a time when I to buy one item at a time, rather than using a bulk upload to generate 900. It gets really annoying. Why aren't they using the poker platoon? Because they don't know everything it a certain way in the navigation. There's nothing to tell them that it's there. Here's this great peach that does exactly what you're trying to do, but yeah.</p><p>Can, when someone is entering in a hundred different products and searching for them one by one, you can flag up, Hey, did you know. If we put this great upload tool, you just paste everything in your list. Then you can add it all into the car at one goal, rather than searching one by one.</p><p>and it's, we forget that our users. Art experts or our website. We assume everybody has the same math knowledge that we do. And I think that's why, empathy goes very closely with one of my big things in Seattle, which is clarity. Everything should be as clear as possible. you shouldn't have to.</p><p>Think about what the next step is, what happens if I click this button, how do I do this? It should just be there. It should just work right this time. It should work exactly how you want to do if I'm tabbing through the site that should work too in our might not be using in my mouse because I've got to take my hands off the keyboard.</p><p>That's how you got to do it. You've got to make it as good for every user as possible. And the only way you can do that is. If you try to do things the way they do it, if you try to mimic their struggles, I think mimicry is a really powerful way to increase empathy because by mimic actions, you can start, build up.</p><p>the empathy to them because you're actually doing what they're doing. Get, literally walking a mile in their shoes, which is the saying that comes along with empathy </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:52] for over 10 years. Now, all my diet of advisors about evidence-based conversion optimization with a focus on data and psychology.</p><p>We see that analyzing data and recognizing customer behavior results in a better online dialogue with your clients and a higher ROI </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:24:07] that team </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:08] of strategists, analysts, psychologists, and UX specialists. Gathering valuable insights in your online behavior of your visitors, gather with you optimize the difference elements of your Ciro program.</p><p>We designed expert reviews, AB test and behavioral analysis. For more information about their services, go to Oman dialogue besides looking at the, at your website and basically becoming your own customer as a business. What you're saying. </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:24:34] Yeah, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:35] essentially. So besides your, the website, would it be other ways of developing your empathy?</p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:24:40] Yeah, so some of the, pork into customers is really great. I think if you can get into the mindset, that's what empathy is literally is. Can you feel the way. Let's do, so one way is to mimic their actions, usual website. They can post them. The other way is to actually find out as much as batch customer as possible.</p><p>Cause if you can stand who they are and what drives them, what motivates them. So the classic one is customer personas. If you have really good customer personas then yeah. that is your empathy right there. That is who they are. What are their struggles? What are their pain points? What are they trying to do?</p><p>What could hold them back? So that's a really good way to develop empathy, be, have to think and feel as customers. If you have a, everyone or your user types on the site, then you have. No, that's a shortcut to get in there. I think that's something that people miss with music is they've tried to build a use of someone, very, very task focused.</p><p>Rather than this is what the use of feels. This is what frustrates them. This is where the lack of knowledge is. So I might be, let's take myself. If I am buying something on behalf and engineer on my current clients website, I am not an engineer. I do not know if this one part is the same as that part.</p><p>All I have to go on his apartment. But so if you show me five products, when I search for that part, which one's the right one, one of the same partner, but they might do the same thing. I don't know that because I'm not the expert on that, but the engineer that is my user's chocolate, that is my pain point.</p><p>That is how I amplify it, empathize with that user. But the only way you find that out is by understanding what they're doing, why they're doing it. And like I said, it's really good customer user research that builds up some really strong someone is well, massively help you cook that. Timed down to understanding and empathizing because you've got your right there.</p><p>You've got really solid. let's see the eyes of my brothers brought the book founded by Saunders, great book. And I saw only about 70 pages as well. So you can read it like an hour, and that tells you how you should build your personas, why they're so important because. As soon as you start building dollars, bam, you can empathize instantly go, right?</p><p>This is John he's the CEO. This is what his issues are. This is James, the engineer. This is why he isn't sure that this is, Tom buyer. This is what he says, this is why he's thinking of bidding, but what might make him stop? But I think, yeah, really good. someone has a massive shortcut to the </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:27:14] empathy.</p><p>Sirens are a nice way to put yourself in someone else's shoes. And that's what empathy is about. You need to, be able to imagine how it is to be someone else. So basically you need to tune down your own feelings and your own, opinions about stuff and be very aware of the biases and how others might think of or how others might see stuff.</p><p>So putting yourself. maybe, in uncomfortable situations with people that think differently than you, or think differently about certain topics, that's going to help you thighs with more and more people's thing. Yeah. But from their perspective, it's a different situation now. I clearly remember, before starting my study in psychology.</p><p>someone thought so most psychologists not. So I did, applied cognitive psychology. Was which more usability aside then? Of course the more, no I'm part of psychology, clinical psychology. I spoke to someone and he said, yeah, it's weird when you start you doing, psychology cause of the empathy part also because before you studied psychology or if you don't haven't, read into psychology at all, when you hear about someone doing really bad behavior, like you hear about, rape crimes or, all kinds of bad behavior.</p><p>normal people will say, Oh, that's horrible. Put them in jail. and that's never talked to them again. if you studied psychology, you would say, Hey, that's interesting. I wonder about his childhood. What do they do? What's happening to him? Why is he doing his relationship with his mother?</p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:28:44] Yeah, exactly. And it's cheap and you start to </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:47] empathize. I said that might be a bit too much. </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:28:50] Yeah, my wife had this, we had this similar arms being upstairs. You're watching a show about psychopaths and I was like, the psychopath isn't doing something bad per se, because obviously they might go and cause about serial killers.</p><p>They might be going back to people, it's. To him, it's not malicious. Cause he has no empathy with his victims. he's not doing it to her, he's doing it for his own selfish needs. So yes, it's very, it's a very selfish thing he's doing, but he, he lacks the ability to feel them relax it most.</p><p>That's why he's doing these kinds of things, as well as the bad childhood, the bad upbringing, et cetera, some genetic component as well. But, yeah. You can't judge a psychopath by it, normally moral standards because it doesn't apply to them. We have not templatized the people. We feel bad if we hurt them.</p><p>And I say, They lack that. So of course, if you lack that self control mechanism, you're potentially going off the deep end. So although there are some very successful psychopaths do really well or, hedge fund managers, surgeons, military people. And it's, I think the upbringing massive X big difference.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:02] One of my favorite tools to, and to instill a bit more empathy in people is. talking about, cognitive biases or teaching them about that or just having them read about it. Cause it's well, I think it's, most people find it's fun to do because it's a confrontational. So with your own thoughts or your own decision making processes working, but also helps you, think about, Hey, he is doing, or he or she is making this decision.</p><p>Oh, Hey, I've read about this bias. it might be that. Yeah. </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:30:29] And something I tried to take train into my teams is how do you spot confirmation bias? Because everybody wants to find stuff that proves that. So when you look at test results, for example, that it's really easy to find the KPI that your test optimized, or find a, a segment where I did really well.</p><p>But actually if you haven't predetermined that then yeah. You're, you are just. Pulling into the confirmation bias trap. I just find that works. I think it goes back to an earlier time because that, when you're committed to organizations that you find happens a lot because they don't have that process.</p><p>So then the confirmation bias is in full effect, then, I'll hold my hands up to as well. I still fall guilty to this as well. I felt lucky, I've planned out my chest and said, my KPI is at the basket of my secretary KPI it's quarters. I have not talked to my AOV. I'm not poked my room near.</p><p>So when I see AOV of revenue go off, I'm like, ah, I really want to call the test and that, but no, I can't because I'm already aye. it's really Siki and it's really hard because when you are invested in something, you really want to prove that yes, I got it. I want that way. And you want that endorphin from a big resort.</p><p>And, so this is why, yeah, it's massively hard to combat from these biases because they're so ingrained into our psyches. They're like mental shortcuts, aren't they? So you know this as a. But it was like hands meant to show up shortcuts to cut down on thinking that it's something that the human brain is hardwired to try to avoid is to cut down to thinking you be very </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:32:01] emotive.</p><p>Yeah. Thinking is really expensive for your brain. So it wants to save as much energy as possible. </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:32:08] I think I've read somewhere that your brain needs is something like 20% of your calories, even though it makes up about 4% of your body weight. But I was like, wow. The brain is such a hungry machine.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:32:17] It's like a T 20 Watts, a light bulb. That's the energy equivalent of your brain. Yeah. </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:32:22] Yeah. So it's, it's massively diff massively difficult to avoid taking, mulching responses. And this is why going back to the empathy is. We think everybody's behaving analytically. I'm going to choose this product because it's better than this product, but actually emotionally, I want that one because it looks nice.</p><p>It's going to fit better on my coffee table. that's the motive, but a standard school, we see people are behaving and purchasing and they're being emotive. So if you can't get inside the mind, how can you then apply to that behavior? because that. stereo might pitch in very nice to decor, but it's not as good as this lovely silver one.</p><p>did you also know it could be a black, but if all you care about is, Hey, look, this has got 500 Watts. This one's already got 10 Watts. but they really liked the color black and they can't see how to change the color on the 501. They're not going to do it. So this is why I said, if we don't get into the emotive part, find what drives you, what has bacon, what is helping them to make these decisions, these mental shortcuts, these emotional responses.</p><p>Then you can't optimize that if you're literally only going by data, when you go to my information, if you want to stay in their box. Purchasing decisions and it's combined set &nbsp;user behavior </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:33:43] by spec offer say worldwide unique AB testing, personalization and product recommendation solution sites, paperworks to service sides without any tags or scripts, which guarantees an optimal performance.</p><p>The SiteSpect solution eliminates delays and the chance of any flickering effects. And this approach also ensures that the current and future brows, stretcher rules like ATP and ATP, don't make an impact on your AB testing and personalization </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:34:10] for more info, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:34:10] visit &nbsp;dot com and developing your empathy.</p><p>It's a double at short. It also works inside the company that you're working for, when presenting those results. And I've made this mistake many times myself by presenting the data. And then not taking into account more emotional, part of the story. And then people rejecting the most incredible, AB test results because they didn't believe in it somehow, or it didn't resonate with their, their emotions around it or their beliefs around it.</p><p>And then, rejecting, Whatever I came up with. so that's, like I said, it's double at short. It also works developing the empathy. It helps you, within your own company or as a consultant, the company that you work for, internally to become a better, become better as you grow. </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:34:56] Yes. I think Claire, we very much, the buzzword for the last few years around data has been storytelling.</p><p>and what is our story? Our story is what's happened. It's about to journey. you start off with the antagonist, the protagonist, they go through some kind of adventures. Eventually they get to the other side and they get the just reward for following the right path. what is a journey?</p><p>it's a roller coaster of emotions. You need to have highs and laws and you need to be able to take your user in this case. Whoever you're pitching your test results to, which is why, I started off my career because I'm very analytical, just showing here's a bar chart is a table. This is the data on tie.</p><p>I'm going to play soul clever people. People just didn't get to. Nike said, I'm not so sure you might need to double check that one, but then you start telling the story. And say hi, so we have this idea and then we did this user research and then we went and, we went and got the salad and we spoke to, I use the snow.</p><p>Yes. I really hate you when this happened. So we would post what's the best way to do we try these different approaches and you take them through that whole journey and you walk them through every step of it. Step by step. Eventually they get to the, get to the promised land and then you realize that and they're like, Oh yes.</p><p>Great. Yeah, I can totally see all the different bits of that. And you've led them through and walk through. And you've told them the story about all the trials and tribulations, all the failures that you had in T bunch, they got white one because, as you people, we tend to just say, Hey, these are the winners.</p><p>And we don't show you that the 10 tests the last to get back. But if you got to show those happy new year, Your, your, product holders and the you CEO's through that journey and show. This is exactly how we got there. These are the trials and tribulations. And how can you tell that story about, or the bad stuff as well as the good stuff?</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:36:47] Exactly. Please. Don't forget about it, people. so thank you so much for taking us through your, thoughts about the empathy. w what are your, what are the things you are going to do in the next 12 months? What are you working on? </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:36:58] yeah, I think to the, I'm working with my current client at the end of the year, and optimizing their sites across the three main regions, North America, Europe, and APAC.</p><p>so we've got a very full. That's in psycho and they've just moved into working agile. So that's really good as well. So helping them with agile ways of working and, personally myself, I think, getting to lock down, hopefully going on a holiday at some point. luckily yeah, in January.</p><p>And then obviously the last time it happened two months later. So at least my having a holiday yet. and my daughter's looking back to going back to school in September. So that would be, yeah. In terms of work next year, we'll see, I'll find it with the client, worked in the industry.</p><p>I've been doing some work with the crap COVID-19 initiative of getting CRL people and being given away an hour of the time as a time, but we could, etc. So working with a few organizations or with an SEO company in Holland, and help them out and gave them some bias. Some also worked with some, A financial services company is donating my time when, cause I thought it's, it's a difficult situation.</p><p>Everybody needs to improve the conversions. Everyone needs to try to make more money, less traffic. most people Amazon's doing really well. I see share prices up 50% year on year. so Jeff Bezos is doing very well for himself. I think he's increased his net worth by about 50 billion down. someone's doing good.</p><p>Okay. But I think there's a lot of people that are struggling. So yeah, I'm trying to do a little bit more of that. Trying to give more back to the community. I was really looking forward to going to commercial tow in November. my favorite conference, I've been in the last four years in a row, but, I don't think it's going to happen this year.</p><p>I'm not managed to go to any conferences. This dad wants to encapsule, but, that's a big shame for me. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:38:58] Yeah. We, what goes on the crap initiative for COVID-19, force heroes. And now if you want to listen to that one, we will link to that in the show notes. And as a final question, any bullshit, like the tip to our audience?</p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:39:12] Yeah. So I've got a couple, I think one was by Nate silver, if you don't know Nate silver and he wants five 38, it's a website that analyzes sports politics and to the science, very data heavy. and he goes into his books is called, I believe he's called and the noise, the signal that is sent by our town.</p><p>Do we separate the signal, the insights from all the noise that we have, you have so much data. You have too much of it. How do we get. What's right now is that action equals to a different examples of where this lack of ability to separate by noise as close to the issue. So I haven't seen from, the big housing market crash caused by or the overleveraging of the banks to, September 11th to, to other bits as well.</p><p>So he walks us through the science as far as involved in, how do you separate noise from data, which is what's the role of people is really important to come back for me. You're essentially trying to do. What is an actual result and what is just noise? so yeah, that's one of my favorite books that I probably read we about once a year, just cause there's so many nuggets in there that it's hard to function for the role.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:40:27] We'll definitely link to that book in the show notes and more. Thank you so much for joining us in the rock face podcast. Thank you very much. Love to talk to you soon and have a good day. Bye bye. Which concludes season two, episode 30, one of this hero cafes, both guys with AMR, Dave Atwell. If you're interested in promoting your production of services to the best heroes in the world, </p><p>Amrdeep Athwal: [00:40:49] at least they can look at </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:40:50] zero.cafe/parking lot to see how we can collaborate.</p><p>And although we started out as a ditch podcast, I can fully understand that you want to skip all the district gobbledygook, please go to zero dot &nbsp;English episodes and to subscribe, to get notified about</p><p>next year, which episode, isn't it. Two weeks in which I talked with expo and founder of experimentation zone, ADA Davis. And in that episode, Ruby talking about.

Interesting stories and knowledge to share with us 25 years in CRI I don't think it's called zero back then. </p><p>Tim: [00:03:05] No, I coined the help coin, the term landing page optimization and conversion rate optimization and some of your European colleagues.</p><p>Yeah. I started calling it CRO, which I violently hate, but okay. That's another </p><p>Guido: [00:03:16] topic, not a topic. And w with all that experience and you've been in this doing this for so long. Why are you still doing it? What is your passion for this field of work? </p><p>Tim: [00:03:27] It's such a fascinating topic, I guess I'm come full circle and I made a career out of technology and learning that didn't exist when I attended the university of California.</p><p>San Diego. I studied computer engineering and cognitive science, which was in the psych department at the time and is now its own department. And so I've always had an interest in cognition. I stayed there for graduate school for my PhD work for seven years in what would now be called neural networks or machine learning, deep learning AI.</p><p>So that was teaching computers to learn by example. So it's always been my passion to understand how people think, how we make decisions. And in a way, the applying that to internet marketing and specifically influencing people when they come to your website, that's the perfect application for it.</p><p>It's this blend of art and science. Everything is infinitely measurable, but at the same time, the principles that influence people are based on psychology. And so I've been exploring the human brain, my </p><p>Guido: [00:04:27] whole career. And so I also have a background in psychology. I don't know how your experience at it.</p><p>But at least here, when I studied it it had nothing to do with align. So maybe your combination with computer science was, it was a bit more focused on that but how did you make that transition? &nbsp;From being doing this stuff offline to online, </p><p>Tim: [00:04:49] , my first jobs were more on the technical side, so they were programming and there worked for big companies and I realized what a soul killing environment that was.</p><p>And I said, this isn't really for me. So in my late twenties, I. I was 29. I quit the PhD program seven years into it, and I started my first business. So I actually got an office space about 200 square meters and a desk and a phone and an internet connection. And then I called up my girlfriend at the time.</p><p>I said, Hey, I'm running around my office naked and sitting at my desk because I can it's my business. So it was really just that entrepreneurial. I'm going to do my thing. And that happened to be in 1995. Right when, the early.com days. &nbsp;It was, it's been a pretty exciting ride. I've seen </p><p>Guido: [00:05:33] the whole thing.</p><p>Talking about that you, there's not your first book that you've written you've already written two other books on landing page optimization. So what were your takeaways from the process? And the writing and the marketing of book one and two. And what did you take take with you to this book?</p><p>Tim: [00:05:52] Yeah, so the original book I wrote was the first edition of landing page optimization, and that was followed up about four years later with the second edition. And this is expanded. This was written with my friends and colleagues rich page and Morgan tees who are super smart and really helped make the second edition.</p><p>Fantastic. And then it's been translated into several languages. There's the German Brazilian Portuguese. I think this is Korean. I'm not sure. I'm pretty sure it's Korean and then Chinese, but my favorites are the Polish Eastern European additions. This one cracked me up. This is my book in Russian, which is my native language.</p><p>I was born in Moscow and I never wrote or heard of it. So it's really trippy to see it that way. But the, to your question writing a book is a huge undertaking. As you probably know you've talked to some authors before each one of those books took two years of my life and that's a big price to pay, especially when you're doing other things, running an agency in my case, raising little kids.</p><p>So you have to really want to give birth to a book. In fact, I joke that's the closest a man will ever come to giving birth. It's a long drawn out. Painful process. It's a bloody mess by the time you're all done. And then the real work begins just like raising a kid, you have to promote the book and so on.</p><p>And then that work never </p><p>Guido: [00:07:15] ends. Yeah. Most authors tell me that. They also say, it must be a very fulfilling thing to do out of your own interest and motivation because. &nbsp;You shouldn't for one, do it for the money. Maybe if you were a New York times bestseller, but otherwise it should really come from the spinoff of the book, but the book itself is not something that you aren't money with.</p><p>Tim: [00:07:35] Yeah. Mine was actually fairly successful. It'd be just the two U S edition sold 50,000 copies, which is a huge hit, especially in an applied like a B2B book. So it's for marketing practitioners. How many of us are there out there? In fact I've had people tell me. Yeah. Or blame me. I always joke, &nbsp;that their career in CRO started by reading my book.</p><p>And I said, don't blame me for your poor career choices. So there is some gratification, but it's a solo activity. Yeah. You have to, you're isolated, you're writing you're in your head. And then maybe a year or two later, someone says, I loved your book, so you get this sporadic. Feedback that's delayed.</p><p>So it's not like keynote speaking, which from the badge wall, you can see, I do a little bit of over the years where you get immediate feedback from the audience with books it's really a solitary activity, writing a </p><p>Guido: [00:08:24] book. Then once it's done, of course you can have a revisions, but that's, it's relatively static compared to when you're talking to an audience and you can adopt.</p><p>While </p><p>Tim: [00:08:33] doing your thoughts on the second to second based on their reactions. Yeah, that's true. </p><p>Guido: [00:08:36] Yeah, of course. We're going to talk about your book, but my last question, before we do that so in, in those 25 years how are we doing with Shiro right now? How do you see </p><p>Tim: [00:08:48] Our, I, you know what, I'm not optimistic because I've seen, generational change.</p><p>I'm a gen X-er and millennials have come along. Now there's gen Z kids coming into the workforce and I see the same kind of mistakes being made on websites. You know what I had this whole chapter, your baby is ugly about the seven deadly sins of websites, and those are still endemic. Those same problems of, visual distractions, not enough trust.</p><p>Not keeping your promises unclear calls to action. &nbsp;They're everywhere. It's not that hard for any of us in the CRO industry. It'll take a look at any website and say it sucks. And here's why, and you don't even need the test. A lot of that stuff just fix it. So we're still there because there's always new people cycling into the industry and the experience of the of the more experienced people.</p><p>Aren't really the ones designing the experiences. It's usually someone new. And until they learn to really care about the user experience and about their putting the priorities of their visitors first that won't change. And that takes a lot of, time and psychological shift to take on that perspective.</p><p>Guido: [00:09:56] Ah, we've proven ourselves enough or as a field, as </p><p>Tim: [00:10:00] heroes or. &nbsp;The, I don't think so. I think that the problem with CRO As an industry. So in terms of the world out there, have we made it better at yeah, maybe few websites, but there's still plenty of ugly babies, as I like to say out there, really dysfunctional websites.</p><p>And so as long as there are websites and that's an important caveat that will probably continue. So good news. We all have job security. Yeah, but eventually won't be websites. It'll be holograms implanted in your skull, or it will be voice or a mobile app or in an app experience on mobile rather, which is not really a website.</p><p>So I guess there, from the broader perspective of our websites better, no, they're not from the perspective of. The industry, I would say the big problem is we're too tools focused. &nbsp;We pay lip service to being user-focused, but we're technology focused and we need to be data-driven and my hypothesis is this.</p><p>If I hear the word hypothesis, one more time, I'm going to lose my lunch. We were trying to make it all scientific and stuff. The bottom line is. You get good ideas for improving websites and you have to make sure they didn't screw things up and make them worse. That's legitimate. But my problem is that there are all these tool companies that have been beating the drum of AB split testing.</p><p>Test this test, this, you should test everything. I've actually had people tell me that really the font in your footer make it readable. You don't need the test. Changing it from eight point the 10 point font, just do it. And so this over-reliance, I would say on quantitative testing everything has to be tested, I think is actually a disservice.</p><p>And so we're seeing as little technicians that are fiddling around with stuff and making tactical changes mostly on single pages. And a lot of the more powerful tools, what I did with my agency site tuners. You have to have a strategic perspective. Sometimes you have to redesign a whole website.</p><p>Sometimes you have to add a personalization layer. Sometimes you have to fix all of your email communications. Sometimes you have to train your customer service people to sell better. On the phone. We did a training for one client trained about 60 of their phone reps. Website sales stayed the same phone sales jumped up 15%.</p><p>That was, we made a millions of dollars with a one week training. So I look at it more like a McKinsey or a high-end consultancy would attack it, which is very strategic and not just this kind of stay in your swim lane and just do your look. </p><p>Guido: [00:12:36] Yes. It feels a bit because we're designing. Those interfaces Omar computer.</p><p>And we don't see, we don't experience how our customer uses it. I think that's an inherent problem or the way we design those things that's inherent to our business, but it's also disconnects us from who we actually designing it for. We're not standing in a store, like it like a sales man in the store. We don't have that immediate feedback again. </p><p>Tim: [00:13:02] Yeah. And &nbsp;it's funny because Ben and Carl, my friends In the UK, they are big advocates for walking a mile or kilometer since they're in the UK, in their visitor's shoes. &nbsp;Think Carl tells the story of they ordered a garden shed and he not only ordered it, he put it together himself and then tried to call customer support for help and stuff like that.</p><p>So how often do we do that? As marketers? We're sitting there talking about my row as is this and this keyword groups performing well and, I'm at 95% significance in this kind of bullshit and we're talking to each other and we never actually talked to the end users of our product or service.</p><p>We should be out there in the field. I think everyone at a larger company should be in customer service at least once a quarter taking phone calls and seeing what's actually happening with their customers. So there's definitely not enough of that. We're in our own little echo chamber.</p><p>Guido: [00:14:23] In the book unleash your primal brain. I actually, I finished at the half an hour ago actually. So I'd actually more out of interest. You did the audio book yourself too which is not but I really love when authors do that, it really gives a different dimension to the book. When it's read by the person that actually wrote a thing that sort of audio books, I think five hours, 16 minutes.</p><p>How long does it take to record something like </p><p>Tim: [00:14:52] that? Oh, yeah, that's a great question. I had to learn it all myself. I decided to do it myself for a couple of reasons. One is apparently for nonfiction, that's actually preferred that the author recorded. It's a selling point with big deal, but also I am an international keynote speaker, so maybe I know how to present and communicate just the thought.</p><p>I I studied everything from how to record it, what software to use, how to clean it up and make it okay for audible and other platforms. And I did all of that myself. It was really fun. I built my own sound isolation booth in my office, out of moving blankets and PVC pipe to cancel all the room echo and basically they say about three hours of total time for one hour finished recorded.</p><p>Now I have to mess around and learn platforms and stuff. But yeah, actually I was under that probably about it's about an hour and a half of editing for me for every hour of finished. That's not too bad. No, it's not too bad. You take out the ohms and ums and the breath sounds you can't put like, Oh, you can't do that on.</p><p>Yeah, exactly. </p><p>Guido: [00:15:59] Nice. So let's get into the book. W what stood out for me, a large part of the book is actually a boss. The evolution &nbsp;and brain biology. &nbsp;And I was wondering, so very recognizable first off from of course studying psychology myself. But I am wondering, so knowing things like like how neurotransmitters work how does that help a regular human being to get insights into their behavior or their in customer's behavior?</p><p>Tim: [00:16:30] Yeah to be clear, the book is not written specifically for marketers. It's not a neuro marketing book, although I, if you read through it, what it is, and in the audio book I use kind of audio call-outs, but throughout the book, there are these call-outs and there are a couple of hundred plus of them and they're the main points.</p><p>And if you pause on each one of those and consider, how does this apply to neuro marketing or marketing more broadly, you could read the book with that prism. But the book is really the basic operating for human beings. It's retracing the arc of evolution from earliest life on earth to what makes us bizarrely and distinctly human.</p><p>And it's saying we picked up stuff along the way, what works is still there and let's figure out, which part of the brain is actually acting in a certain situation. So it's, you can use it for business leadership, persuasion, marketing sales, you can use it for personal relationships and. Culture building and organizational psychology.</p><p>You can use it for personal development, sleep memory. What makes us happy, whether it makes sense to chase happiness in the first place. So it's really what all 8 billion of us on the planet have in common. It's not an applied. Book stay tuned. I may write eventually in the same series, primal brain marketing, primal brain leadership, primal brain personal improvement.</p><p>So those would be layered on applied books, but this one is the why behind our evolutionary psychology. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:17:53] It feels especially as a, as someone interested in this topic, it feels like a like a history book almost of collecting all those bits and pieces of how the brain evolves. And how it worked out.</p><p>So it does really well. </p><p>Tim: [00:18:06] Yeah. Thank you. I, to be really approachable, there is an a book and a TV series in the U S many years ago by Carl Sagan called cosmos. It was like the Neil deGrasse Tyson, one Dido, if you will, and billions of stars, and he would make astrophysics fun for the common person.</p><p>And a lot of people were turned on by it. And so this is my attempt to do the same thing for how our brains really work. I'm trying to make it accessible to everyone. My problem was that there are a lot of specialist books and most of them were unreadable. Everybody talks about condiments work.</p><p>For example, thinking fast and slow. That's that book's about a thousand pages and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. It's it's an important book. Therefore, you should read it, but it, it's written by a researcher and he's not a good writer and neither a lot of the other people.</p><p>So there's all these perspectives, </p><p>Guido: [00:18:56] like I said, in the book &nbsp;it's being human one Oh one or how the brain works. One-on-one I think it's will be also for. Obviously for the general public, but also I think for students doing this or cognitive sciences, it will be a great starting points </p><p>Tim: [00:19:11] To and you ask how this applies to marketing.</p><p>So to return to that question I think that anybody that is in marketing, it doesn't understand what they're trying to influence, which is the human brain is at a huge disadvantage. So we're thinking about. Twitter this and, &nbsp;retargeting that. And it's again, mostly technology-based and you really, if you want to have a durable career as a marketer, we don't care online, offline, you have to understand what you're trying to influence and that's the human brain.</p><p>So that, to me, this is foundational </p><p>Guido: [00:19:41] stuff. Yeah. Often what I see going wrong with what, when people talk about children, for example the book is fine. And the theories are fine, but it's not as random. It feels sometimes it feels a bit random just to just, okay, we need to do social proof or we need to do at the uncertainty or at scarcity or whatever.</p><p>And it's not fair for us to figure out where the issue is where people are getting stuck and could be because of their behaviors, how the brain works and then apply something that's compensated for that. We'll fix that. </p><p>Tim: [00:20:14] Yes. And I think that's another issue I have is from the behavioral economics side or the neuro marketing side.</p><p>There's all these like tips and tricks and wheels of persuasion. And here's a thousand tactics you can use to basically manipulate me. But there's no. Common through line through any of it. And so I'm trying to explain the why and say, this is a result of evolution and there's many different layers to it.</p><p>So it's an ambitious book in the sense that it, like you said, covered neurochemistry sleep, memory, learning, language, culture, gender differences are highly social natures. But you kinda need to retrace that whole arc to see. What, where those unconscious shortcuts are coming from, which stage of evolution is really impacting that or causing it if you will.</p><p>Yeah. Then it becomes much more coherent instead of just a bunch of tactics. </p><p>Guido: [00:21:08] Exactly. Yeah. And yeah, it doesn't, there's no shortage of tactics in our field. </p><p>Tim: [00:21:15] No, everyone's got a blog post with the top 10 ways to manipulate </p><p>Guido: [00:21:19] people. You mentioned the economy. When we talk about the primal brain w would it be similar to Conoman system one?</p><p>Tim: [00:21:29] Yeah. And again, making a technical, but the way that I look at it, there's the reasoning brain, the neocortex, the one that has access to language. And would you consider conscious thought? But most of your life is on autopilot. There's massive amounts of information coming at you every second, just even right now, you're listening to me.</p><p>You're feeling the pressure of the chair on your butt. The relationship of all of your joints and space, which is why when you eat something, you don't stick the fork in your head by accident, right? There's all this information coming in at 99.999%. That is ignored because it doesn't have survival value.</p><p>But it's happening automatically. That process never stops. It never gets tired. Contrast that with conscious thought, asking for our conscious attention is really hard as a marketer because the scarce resource and we conserve it and we get tired later in the day and we don't make good decisions. So all of that conscious stuff is a completely different thing.</p><p>And people think that. Rationality is the ultimate human thing, right? Oh, if we could only take those irrational passions and emotions, then we'd all be like Mr. Spock and making perfect decisions. That's actually not a good view of humanity. 95% of what we're doing is subconscious. And so let's understand that part </p><p>Guido: [00:22:49] better.</p><p>Yeah. And it doesn't necessarily have to be better to make a logical decision. Those emotions. I have served those as well. They are there for a reason. You basically all your parents, your grandparents, and the whole lineage that you have, they survived because they have had those instincts.</p><p>Tim: [00:23:05] For billions of years. In fact, you said, instead of making a logical decision there, let me be super clear. There is no such thing as a logical decision. I mean that literally there've been brain damaged. People had certain parts of their brain disconnected or not working. And what we found from the neurosciences that you can't make a logical decision.</p><p>The emotions are what the side. So logic gives you options. Here's 50 things you could do right now. And emotion quickly and says, okay, these are the ones that matter. I either hate this or I love it. I've have a strong emotion. And that's how decisions get made. There's literally no such thing as a logical decision.</p><p>Guido: [00:23:45] Yeah, exactly. And one thing that I also really liked how you mentioned that the new book is that basically after you're born. &nbsp;You still need to download besides all the physical learning, not to stick your fork in your head. Although my two year old still, I still doubt that you also need to download all the cultural values and that's a really important part of of being human, it takes roughly 20 years to fully do that. &nbsp;And despite having all the, these underlying shared biology that cultural part is really important. Can you give us a couple of examples of those things that, </p><p>Tim: [00:24:25] Think that to understand humans and why we took off on the planet, like when overran it and her about to kill it, I believe is because of our success in transmitting culture.</p><p>That's our big evolutionary bet other animals have two advantages. If they occupy a wide ecological range, they adapt physically to that. So squirrels run have rotating ankles so they could run down tree trunks, or some of them have wings, so they can fly between trees. They're adapting to their environment, physically.</p><p>Humans didn't do that. We placed one big bet on culture spread and in order to have these very expensive brains, about three times more expensive to run than any other primate we decided to delay and make compensating kind of effects throughout our body. Our digestive system is smaller.</p><p>Our muscles are weaker. All of that is so we can grow our brain. In fact, Adolescence is delayed. I have two teenagers in the house and they go crazy and hormones kick in and they grow to their adult size and sexual maturity very quickly. That's so you can keep the body small and keep wiring up the brain.</p><p>And so our advantage is the stuff we learn from people around us gives us an edge for our particular environment. It's not physical adaptations. It's yeah. Cultural knowledge. And so because of that, we have all these weird adaptations, like human beings live decades longer than it passed their reproductive years.</p><p>No other mammal does that. And that's so we can spread knowledge and we can, the grandmothers and grandfathers can teach the children. It's a, there's this kind of cultural transmission is the key for us. Downloading things like in the matrix movie, I want to download the program to fly the helicopter.</p><p>Okay, great. As babies we're doing that by watching people around. </p><p>Guido: [00:26:12] Yeah. Yeah. You don't see other species doing things like public speaking and that. That's was </p><p>Tim: [00:26:17] really well that too. Yeah. Language is definitely helps in all of this. But it's culture spread that makes us human and that, that has some good and bad implications for tribes and the values that we hold and co competition among tribes.</p><p>That's definitely part of our psychology. </p><p>Guido: [00:26:34] Yeah. Yeah, no. Interesting. I wondered came from your book. I think it was dominance versus prestige. Dominance is obviously something that you definitely see in the animal kingdom that prestige that's something specifically human. </p><p>Tim: [00:26:46] Yeah. So let's talk about that.</p><p>So they're independent species like crocodiles and fish might spawn a hundred million eggs and hope a few of them survive, but it's not exactly caretaking for the children. You know what I mean? Even birds, they sit on the egg, but feed the little bird, but then you're on your own. Mammals have to survive in Hertz.</p><p>So you have the protection of the group, even though we're individually weaker than most of these independent type of animals. So there's then you have this stuff of like, how do I behave in my group to minimize the social consequences to me, you have bad things happening but still get what I need.</p><p>So there you have like that. The dominant alpha individuals, males, and females, and they get all the food mating opportunities, safety of being in the middle of the herd. So that's basically bullying. Okay. We have a president like that in the white house right now, hopefully for not much longer. So some people can get away with that, but generally we're cooperative.</p><p>And so for human beings to spread culture, you not only have to want to learn and we're incredible mimics. And, but to know who to learn from. And then those people have to want to teach you because I studied martial arts and in the Chinese martial arts, there's this notion of an indoor student. Like you don't really see the good stuff you're out in the courtyard practicing until you're invited years later to be an indoor student after you've shown your willingness to stick it out.</p><p>Karate kid style. So is somebody you have to have, somebody wants to teach. And it gets psychic benefit or survival benefits from teaching and transmitting culture. And that's something other animals don't have. </p><p>Guido: [00:28:20] Yeah, exactly. And shame is not a one, right? That's not something that's also something that you need to develop a one-year-old doesn't really have shame.</p><p>Tim: [00:28:28] There's also something that's an interesting thing. There's a lot of group pressure in the West. We have this mistaken notion that we're individuals. And that my individual happiness matters and I'm so unique and wonderful, but that very notion of being an individual was snuck into our heads.</p><p>We're very much influenced by the people around us and the cultural norms that they're transmitting. And if you don't follow the norms, there's this escalating consequences that happen. We're all enforcers of the rules. In other words, even if we don't know. That there are social rules. We, what they are rather, we assume that we're operating in a world of social rules.</p><p>And so if you break norms, we can gossip about you. It can end your personal relationships. We can deny you economic opportunities. It can banish you. We can even kill you depending on how important the rules are to our culture. So this notion of censorship and shaming other people and getting them to fall in line.</p><p>That's so we can, again, transmit that cultural knowledge more efficiently. Yeah. Somebody in an individual and doesn't listen, they're not a good team player. And so our team versus the other team we're going to lose if we can't spread culture quickly. So we sanctioned people. Including was shame. That's a pretty mild one, but to help with that </p><p>Guido: [00:29:47] culture spread.</p><p>Yeah. I think w in the final part of the book, you also, you give a couple of tips how to unleash your primal brain. And one of them is also to make your group bigger, right? I think that's the tendency is the other way around, at least for me, you'll see. Okay. I have 10 million Twitter followers, but that's not really what we mean here by </p><p>Tim: [00:30:07] getting, by making your group.</p><p>Yeah, certainly I think that at the end I talk about this is more of my wish and my prescription for having our society improve. And you're right. That's attaching to bigger and bigger tribes. You don't think of it as a concentric series of tribes. There's me. There's my immediate family.</p><p>There's my community, my synagogue or church or temple then there's my towns, state city sorry country. The universe or the earth, all living things on the earth besides humans and so on. So what if you have too small of a tribe, if you say I'm only, I only care about my city or my country, everybody else becomes in the out-group and you struggle against them.</p><p>They're the other. And you can see people's stoking fears. Dividing us, these populous kind of leaders, all, not just in the U S but all over the world, and they're playing on the fears of the other and dehumanizing them, making them seem alien. So you have to go out of your way to build bridges and connections and experience things that are the opposite of what you're getting.</p><p>And one of the problems with our age is that in the age of social media, most of us live in little echo chambers, where we just have people that. I think just like us and we, therefore we think the whole world is like that and it's not. And if the center's going to hold together, we have to actively make the effort to understand others and experience other cultures and people.</p><p>Guido: [00:31:37] So what would your advice be? How are you make your inner group there than it </p><p>Tim: [00:31:41] is right now? It's not about making your group bigger. It's about willing spending your time with other people. So yeah. For example in the U S right now, the black lives matter movement is because of the injustice in our criminal justice system is very popular and people say I'm not prejudiced against black people, or I have a black friend, as well.</p><p>Like I remember one time distinctly, I was in junior high school and when went on a family trip to Washington DC and large portions of Washington are largely black. And so we went to the main mall, the Smithsonian and so on. And then we went a few blocks off the mall to go to a pizza place. And it was really odd for me to be surrounded pretty much only by black people.</p><p>And then, so I try to Turn that around and say that's what black people must feel like in a room full of white people. And it was uncomfortable for me, and for no particular reason, if I spend a lot of time in mixed neighborhoods, that would be different. And that's my point. When was the last time you talked to someone of a different culture or different religious belief or even things like riding the bus to school?</p><p>A lot of kids in the U S or bus to schools to, so they wouldn't be as segregated. You have to stretch yourself to put yourself in situations that you feel at least uncomfortable and in order to get used to it and feel more comfortable and understand, there are people just like you.</p><p>Guido: [00:33:29] Speaking of of social groups. I think this is a really tough go on. Let me quote from your book. If people become socially isolated, they stop meddling and simulating the feelings of others and </p><p>Tim: [00:33:41] yeah. They stopped modeling and simulating the feelings of others. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:33:46] And now of course we have this pandemic and physical distancing.</p><p>And how do you choose governments and other organizations try to compensate for this? Because it can have long lasting effects. </p><p>Tim: [00:33:59] I'm not sure you can. My point is that we're really hyper social and isolation is the worst thing you can do to someone. I think if we look back on our times and we look at, for example, supermax prisons or somebody in a cage for 23 hours a day, and then they go to exercise by themselves in an outdoor cage for the remaining hour, that's inhumane people literally go insane in that environment because of the isolation.</p><p>So we need human contact. There's no way to compensate for it. 20 seconds of skin to skin contact releases, oxytocin, which is the mother's child bonding, chemical. It makes us feel good, right? If we feel safe and protected, they're in group, there's no substitute for that. No number of zoom meetings is going to fix that.</p><p>And I think you're seeing this crisis in mental health, domestic abuse, depression, especially among younger children who are forming their identity based on their peer group. I have two in the house there they're severely depressed at times. It's no joke. I think, suicides and things like that are a real risk.</p><p>So we are the there's this longitudinal study about kids that attended Harvard and they're South Boston kind of poor cousins, if you will. And they've tracked these people now for 70, 80 years, and they found that the thing that most contributes to your wellness and life expectancy is your degree of social connection that not having that as the equivalent of being a two pack a day, cigarette smoker.</p><p>So don't underestimate the need for social interactions, with whatever your tribe is. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:35:34] Get out the door, </p><p>Tim: [00:35:37] get out the door, go see people face to face. </p><p>Guido: [00:35:39] Yeah. Yeah, exactly. What would be your tips for CRO? So let's get back to that enforce euros that, that are working in a company and want to create a larger support base.</p><p>within that company. Not, everyone's working at a booking.com where we're experimentation is a, the way of living. And that's obviously a topic often mentioned to you in the podcast. How do we create this culture of experimentation and validation? </p><p>Tim: [00:36:07] Okay, now again, culture and culture spread.</p><p>It's interesting. You have to have influencers that seed that. So people that have influenced within the company, one of the biggest mistakes I've seen, and I actually had a client tell me this one's well, CRO is a swim lane. We have. SEO. We have PPC. We have CRO affiliate. It's just stay in your swim lane, and I think if you've as a tactical little activity and we keep talking with words like hypothesis, and again, not one of my favorites and our technical little jargon, we're not going to get a seat at the grownup table.</p><p>All of the management cares about one thing. They speak one language and that's money. Unless we're talking money, they're not going to pay attention unless we're talking to the upper management, they're not going to pay attention. So one of the things that's I've found determined success is where does CRO report in the organization?</p><p>If you don't have air cover from a senior executive is probably not going to work and keep doing your job. Like I said, you'll be employed for life. There's no shortage of crappy websites, but if you want to have access or rather you need access to senior management and they need to think of you as more strategic, if all it is just tactical testing activities and there's no bigger optimization initiatives going on at the company.</p><p>Yeah. There's no way to change it. Yeah. Yeah. I was </p><p>Guido: [00:37:29] talking to to Johnny London the other week for us, for the podcast. We spoke about the topic was mainly about embedding Ciero into an agile environment, but actually the conclusion was if you have an agile environment and you don't do zero, you don't have a proper agile environment because you're not including the user in there.</p><p>And it should be included in the whole process right in, and definitely Nolan swim lanes. It's something you should adopt. Company-wide. </p><p>Tim: [00:37:54] Yeah, but I also, the very notion of agile is tactical. We were doing a sprint, it lasts a week, then we might adjust, then we're going to do something different.</p><p>So it's very on the ground tactical. And what I'm saying is where I've seen it succeed as like my friend, Joe megabyte, he's now the CEO of the mattress company purple. But before that he was the senior vice president. Of optimization at Expedia and he reported to the president of Expedia. And I once did a training day, like presented at their international optimization summit.</p><p>And their goal was to improve revenue by 5%. Company-wide. And it doesn't seem like an ambitious goal, but this is a, they were a $20 billion company. So it was a billion dollars. They were trying to add to their top line. That's a significant activity. And so he reported. Directly, like I said, up to the present, he started with two people, I believe under him and then grew this out and was overseeing all the different optimization groups at their different properties worldwide.</p><p>And they hit those goals and much more that became a driver of the business. But again, you need a strategic view of it. If it's just a tactical activity it's not, it's going to fail because you can't control the business model. You can't control the user experience. You can't control the.</p><p>Communication the content marketing or the email marketing. So if you're just screwing around with UX on the website. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:39:21] And, but you don't necessarily have to start there either. Usually my idea is if you can start a company doing that for the first half year or first year it's fine doing those technical things but prepare yourself for a more elaborate role within the company and try to move up.</p><p>Tim: [00:39:39] That's right. And you should be asking all the hard questions, go to the CFO and say, what's our customer lifetime value. Most companies have no clue until you, you have to pull teeth to get that data. And even if you have to do it based on assumptions, the fact that you're asking those questions is going to make you more influential.</p><p>Guido: [00:39:56] Yeah. Yeah. I once worked for a company that's over 60 years old and I have no idea what they're, what the average customer value was. And it wasn't an online business, obviously because it's six years old. But I'm like, okay, but you're doing this for four, six years. So no one ever asked that question, this question, how has that a thing?</p><p>How is that possible? How do you not know? And of course for was that specifically for that case there was a, it was lead generation. So basically you do a throw in a lot of money at the websites to get more leads, but no one had any idea what the value of a lead was. You can </p><p>Tim: [00:40:31] imagine it that's unfortunately we were laughing, but that's probably a what?</p><p>80%, 90% of the time. That's the case. Yeah, that's a shame. </p><p>Guido: [00:40:39] And I think the final one for me that that's stood out for me for the book, the final tip, I think in the, in chapter 23, 24 then I don't see coming along that much in, in these kind of books is get more sleep. </p><p>Tim: [00:40:54] Oh that, if there's a personal, if you want to have a happy life, sleep is not optional.</p><p>It's daily life support. Here's a thought every animal or insect that lives more than a few days on this planet has some form of sleep. If it wasn't important, it wouldn't happen. It's so if you want to maintain your life, Human beings have a very intensive need for sleep. We shortened our sleep because once we came out of the trees, it became much more dangerous on the ground.</p><p>We have more intense sleep with a lot more REM. Most of that REM sleep is tail weighted in the night. And so if you're robbing yourself of that final couple of hours, that 90 minutes last sleep cycle you're not creative. You're not learning anything, including physical skills. You're miss calibrating social interactions, which is what allows us to be effective.</p><p>So you think people are more aggressive and you get more paranoid essentially from lack of sleep. We've all seen these effects, but we still think that pulling out our phone and looking at it one more time and. Or binge watching, one more episode is the right thing to do. It's not. Yeah. I, my kids moved to a later sleep schedule.</p><p>I just go 10 o'clock I'm going to bed because my body wakes me up around six. That's it you vampire stay up all night. I'm not going to short change my sleep anymore. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:42:10] And it also changes depending on your age rights at the home, how much sleep you need and when do you need it? During the day, </p><p>Tim: [00:42:15] Yeah, kids need more sleep.</p><p>And they are on an earlier schedule, teenagers flip till much later scheduled and even adults, but they still need a lot of sleep and no adults. You pretty much need seven to nine hours a day. </p><p>Guido: [00:42:27] Your whole life. I think it wasn't American. The university did, they said basically before 10, 11:00 AM.</p><p>It doesn't make sense to get students to school because </p><p>Tim: [00:42:37] still school. Right now it's all virtual. So I guess you can call it homeschool, but our high schools just flipped to a later schedule. That's the science, so that teenagers stay up later and wake up later. In our district, that was the opposite high school was the earliest start time.</p><p>7:00 AM. Whereas it was at like eight 30 for the elementary schools. Now they flipped it. So high school doesn't start till nine o'clock and then that's how you get better performance. Yeah, I'm </p><p>Guido: [00:43:03] good. Yeah. The sleep part really resonated with me in my former life. Being part of the national swimming team, we basically had to report on three things.</p><p>It was the exercise that we did while we got into our bodies food wise, the diet and number three was sleep. And yeah, it was sleeping shorter. Definitely what we didn't have any quality scores for sleep, but definitely sleeping shorter, definitely correlated highly with bad performance overall.</p><p>Tim: [00:43:28] Yeah. Yeah, including if you just did, if you practice some skill physical skill, like swimming and you didn't get proper sleep, it won't get encoded. So you didn't get the benefit of the skill. So trying to cram all night for a test is stupid. Just study less and get extra sleep and you'll do better because at least you'll retain that new information.</p><p>So yeah, everybody says, diet, exercise, sleep, it was always a third one. It should be the opposite sleep is foundational, which also. It impacts your diet and your exercise and then everything else is layered on top of it. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:44:01] Nice Tim for the book. &nbsp;Thanks for writing it in the first place.</p><p>I think it's a great addition. &nbsp;What we already have out there. I think a great starting point for digital marketeers. Like you said, that half currently, no ID what you're actually optimizing for. And there's a brain on the other side of that screen that wants to be influenced.</p><p>And but there are some basics that that might help you some basic knowledge that might help you do this. &nbsp;You already mentioned that there's going to be, unleash. XYZ. It's going to be in </p><p>Tim: [00:44:28] health series, possibly. Although, like I said, writing books as a huge task. And I'm just want to get the word out about this one.</p><p>And I think this is, like I said, what the 8 billion of us have in common. So I think it has a pretty wide applicability and the early reviews are all fantastic. In fact, you mentioned Robert Cialdini. He was kind enough to actually blurb the book. On the front cover because he loved it. So I'm very proud of that.</p><p>He and I have keynoted at some events together. He's a professional crush of mine, so that was really flattering. But so yeah, there, there will be other books in the series, but don't hold your breath. I need to take a rest from writing this one. Yeah, </p><p>Guido: [00:45:06] exactly. It seems like you already purpose of this urge to ride because my book actually says corporate rights, 20, 21.</p><p>Tim: [00:45:13] The U S edition is technically coming out in April of 2021. So right now you can get the eBooks everywhere, the audio books everywhere. And if you want autograph copies of the paperback, I have some pre-release author copies that, that I you can get on the website, primal brain.com. But yeah, if you want the U S edition, it's not out till April six, 20, 21, but the Australia and the new Zealanders, get it before us because My friend, Tony Nash runs Booktopia in Australia and their Booktopia additions division published the separate edition in September.</p><p>So if you're an Aussie or a Kiwi, you can get your copy. Now </p><p>Guido: [00:45:52] we'll add some on LinkedIn show notes. People do to order those those </p><p>Tim: [00:45:56] versions. Yeah. Just go to primal brain.com and it has the where to get it information on the site, along with the table of contents and the introduction and the other stuff.</p><p>Exactly. </p><p>Guido: [00:46:05] Tim final question back to the beginning. So we started off talking about you having all this experience for the last 25 years. What is one experience that you are think you have a one insight that you have that you think others. I have not to catch up on yet in industry. </p><p>Tim: [00:46:22] It's still a mindset.</p><p>I think even in CRO, our center of gravity is still inside of a company and mine has always been through ruthlessly advocate for the needs of your visitors. And so if you just, they don't have a seat at the table, they're like, say marketing's got it. Sales has got it. Operations has a seat at the table.</p><p>Your customers don't have a seat at the table. So your job as a CRO is still only advocate for the needs of your customers. If you align their needs and understanding of their needs with your company strategy, that's how you make money. And again, I just fear that we're too much inside of our companies though.</p><p>So get out of your office, talk to your actual customers. You'll learn a lot more that way than by, flipping through your spreadsheets and your campaign analysis. We </p><p>Guido: [00:47:11] opened Google analytics for it 20 times a day. It's not going to give you the biggest insights. </p><p>Tim: [00:47:19] No. In fact, you're a, you're on a single track in your, in you're stuck there </p><p>Guido: [00:47:23] then.</p><p>Thank you so much. And my my final question to you what do you think I should invite to the zero queer podcast for another episode? And what should I ask? Oh, </p><p>Tim: [00:47:34] well again, I think Dr. Cialdini would be my vote, Robert Cialdini and his book is called influence the psychology of persuasion. And that's one of the Bibles in our field.</p><p>He just came out with a new one called Pre-Suasion about influencing people as well. So you might want to invite him. </p><p>Guido: [00:47:54] Yeah, we actually spoke to a boss routers. &nbsp;He re co-wrote a Dutch book. On online influence and they are actually releasing their book together with Jill Dini. And he's also going to try to persuade, they need to do a podcast with me.</p><p>So if we approach it from enough angles yeah. Maybe </p><p>Tim: [00:48:14] yeah, </p><p>Guido: [00:48:14] that would certainly be helpful. My question will be what's going to be persuasive principle number eight. </p><p>Tim: [00:48:21] It's yep. Yeah I reread recently, re-read the the four agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz. And they came out with another book cause like the fifth agreement, it's I didn't get that in the first book.</p><p>So now I get the deal follow </p><p>Guido: [00:48:34] up. It's a little scratch in the first version, but it's still there. Yeah. Yeah. &nbsp;If chilled any, if you go to Wikipedia, if you look at psychoactive biases, there's a, there's over I think six, 700 of them. You can write a couple, but </p><p>Tim: [00:48:46] it's like what? I think the reason that he really liked my book, especially the last part about what makes us human is I talk about our highly social natures, but again, the evolutionary, why behind it.</p><p>So if you can look at his six or seven and you can see from an evolutionary perspective, how they all make sense and why they're so compelling. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:49:04] And that's the interesting part about your. A history lesson in the most positive way. Because then you try, you don't only learn about those tactics, but also why they evolved that way, why it's working that way.</p><p>Tim: [00:49:17] Yeah. And again, you say it as a history lesson, &nbsp;want to be super clear. I wrote this book without any bullshit. When I was done writing a chapter, I just stopped writing. If I didn't have anything else to say, it's designed to be readable. There's no footnotes, there's no end notes.</p><p>There's a recommended reading appendix, books that you might want to look at, but this is designed to be very easy to read. As from the audio book. I designed it to be read out loud. It's hopefully an engaging style. It's not some chore like reading a history book. No, </p><p>Guido: [00:49:47] definitely not.</p><p>No you definitely succeeded as doing that now. Congratulations. Thank you, my friend. Tim, thank you so much for doing this and I'll talk to you soon.</p><p>‍</p>",true,

And before we dive into our main topic, I wanted to ask you about something you said at the digital elite conference in April last year. And you expressed the hope that people in CRO in 2019. We'll start answering bigger questions.</p><p>So instead of just optimizing landing pages or just forums, or dare I say, button colors, we should all focus more on the actual product offering pricing schemes, or the markets that companies address. Um, how far do you think we are in this? </p><p>Stephen: [00:00:36] I would say for the most part, we're pretty. Um, pretty early on in that journey.</p><p>I think there's a, there's a long way for us to go to, um, what we can do to test that. Yeah. Like at the moment, most people are kind of testing, typically testing. Changes that they would make. Anyway, in other words, if AB testing didn't exist, would you still make this change? And for most people they probably would.</p><p>So they're kind of testing something that they consider to be the best practice or kind of logical idea. And so in doing that, it doesn't really kind of stray too far from what. They would do anyway. And I think that undervalues the role, that experimentation complaint, </p><p>it </p><p>Guido: [00:01:15] feels more like as like a safeguard, like, okay, I want to do this, but I don't want to feel too big.</p><p>So let's, let's check this before we put it live. </p><p>Stephen: [00:01:22] Yeah. I mean, sometimes it's not it's. A safeguard implies that you could potentially fail. Like sometimes I feel like the reason why people run AB tests is to see how clever they are. Like, um, you know, I got this idea, let's, let's test it. And then I can use that to show them how much of a good idea it was to do it.</p><p>I think a lot of the time people aren't testing concepts that are bold enough to, to fail in a big way. And obviously you shouldn't be looking to fail in a big way, but you should be testing ideas that have the potential to go. Um, Opposite ends of the spectrum, as opposed to just kind of oscillating around, um, around the middle.</p><p>Yeah. So yeah, I think it's, I think it's still a very fair point that a lot of people are kind of testing, fairly simple, uh, concepts that are kind of, I guess, while they might expect to see on the competitor's websites. Um, whereas experimentation should give us the power to test pretty much anything it's like, we have a whole kind of.</p><p>Alternative reality that we, where we get to play God, we get to kind of create that new experience and decide what it should be and then see whether it performance better or not. But then people still kind of. Keeping it so close to what they have already. </p><p>Guido: [00:02:38] And why do you think that is? Uh, is it, is it like, uh, the, the corporate culture is, are we not, uh, exploring enough?</p><p>Are we not that don't, we dare enough, uh, to do exceptional things or to the extreme things or, </p><p>Stephen: [00:02:52] yeah, I certainly think that the culture is, is part of it, but I think also the, um, The culture point can only be used as an excuse so far. I think it goes both ways and the culture is by its nature that the people and how they act.</p><p>And so it's on us as experiments it's I guess, to, to, to help inform and change that culture. So yes, certainly the culture is part of it. And a lot of the time when people within a company wants to run a bold experiment, they get pushed back and people don't want to do it. And that's, that's totally fair enough, but there's still ways around that.</p><p>I think. A big part of it is also that we don't always, and this applies just as much to myself as, as anyone else. We don't always have the imagination or inspiration to put forward those Boulder concepts. When you're looking to, to optimize a, a website, the temptation is violence. Look at what it looks like today and come up with somebody that is for what we can test.</p><p>And he tends to keep it fairly close to what is already there. You don't tend to come up with a. Baltimore creative ideas, you know, the, throw it out and start again. Concepts, if you do that. Yeah. So I think it's certainly culture is part of it, but it's also on, on us as CRO professionals to, um, to, to push, to push that forward and, and </p><p>Guido: [00:04:11] try and change it.</p><p>Wanna hear more from you, uh, later on in his episodes about how to come up with more disruptive ideas. And this is a nice segue into the blog post you create it's about using experimentation to manage risk or create a risk profile. I think that's, uh, an important part in, in. Well becoming more disruptive.</p><p>You need to know, be aware of the risk you're um, uh, you're having, um, so first off, what is a risk profile? Let's start with that one. </p><p>Stephen: [00:04:39] I think everybody has a risk profile in their experimentation strategy, whether they know it or actively manage it or not, but I've seen just some experiments that you do will be low risk.</p><p>They will be iterations of something that you have tested before. And. You saw work, um, and others will be a medium risks that might be where you're testing a completely new concept, but it's unlikely to have an effect outside of the experiment itself. In other words, when you stop the experiment, that's when you limit the impact.</p><p>And then there could be high risk experiments. So these are ones where it's potentially more likely to have an effect even after you've stopped the experiment. So if you're testing pricing, if you're a relatively high profile company and you're testing something that people might pick up on, on social media or in the press, for example, then those are likely to be higher risk experiments.</p><p>So most companies will be doing. A mix of these experiments already, mostly low and medium risk experiments. Typically. Um, my, my belief is that companies should be managing a fairly balanced portfolio, including some high risk experiments, because ultimately those are the ones that your competitors are less likely to run.</p><p>Those are the ones that will give you the competitive advantage. Those are the ones that will help you go from the, the, the local. A Maxima to the global max. So in other words, rather than helping you to optimize and iterate on what you already have, it can show you where there's a much greater potential elsewhere.</p><p>And you only get that by testing those more radical concepts. </p><p>Guido: [00:06:21] Yeah. You already mentioned, uh, those competitors, but not running an experiment is also a risk, right? </p><p>Stephen: [00:06:27] Absolutely. Yeah. I think that's, that's entirely fan is it's something that often people will, will overlook. Um, Not running an experiment can mean either changing a website without, without testing it, which is obviously quite significant risk or not changing our website and leaving it as it is because you're too afraid to touch it, which again is a significant risk because.</p><p>Um, hopefully your competitors would be testing and optimizing and continuing to evolve and then doing so they are gaining a significant advantage over you. So you can't do nothing. You can't change your website without test it. So you have to test in a. Logical and scalable way and to do so means getting the balance right between those low, medium and high risk.</p><p>Guido: [00:07:10] So I think, I think many, a chiro practitioners already use a framework for prioritizing tests. Would you say that's very similar to a risk profile or do we need to add something to it or </p><p>Stephen: [00:07:21] I must admit, I struggle with a lot of the prioritization methods out there. This is probably. A whole other, a whole other podcast.</p><p>Um, but for me, I think the, the challenge with a lot of prioritization methods, um, is that a bad call, they have essentially comes down to a fairly subjective belief, which is at some point you're going to be asked essentially, what is the expected impact of this test? The problem with that is. It's it's, it's very subjective.</p><p>You know, your idea for potential impact might be different to, to mind for the same experiment. It becomes very hard to do that in a consistent logical way. That is one of the main driving practice behind how you prioritize her expense. And then, um, starts to call into question the whole. Value of that price and privatization method.</p><p>Um, the approach that we use is, is a little bit different. We try to make it as data-driven, as, as possible, um, with the data being the evidence that you've gained either from previous experiments or from customer research and using that to inform the prioritization. Um, so we, we talked about this quite a bit on our blog, um, where we talk about the score, um, prioritization method, um, But yeah, I think I wouldn't have thought that risk is necessarily something that comes into most people's privatization methods.</p><p>Even the, the, the score methodology. When, when we wrote that blog post, I don't know that we necessarily had, in fact, no, I don't think we did factor risk as a, um, Significant effect into in, into that at the time either. So it's certainly something that, that needs to needs to evolve </p><p>Guido: [00:09:05] over 10 years. Now, all my dialogue advisors about evidence based version optimization with a focus on data in psychology, we see that analyzing data and recognizing customer behavior results in a better online dialogue with your clients and a higher ROI that team of strategists, analysts, psychologists, and UX specialists.</p><p>Gathering valuable insights in your online behavior of your visitors, gather with you. They optimize the difference elements of your zero program. Through we designed expert reviews, AB test and behavioral analysis. For more information about their services, go to Owen dialogue. What is that? Is that the moments that you usually do there, a prioritization for your experiments?</p><p>Is it also the moment you evaluate those, those risk factors? </p><p>Stephen: [00:09:50] So it's normally when we're doing the ideation phase. So, um, prioritization is, is typically something that should, it's not a kind of one off event. Um, in, in my belief, most people treat it as though you come up with a list of. 20 experiments.</p><p>And then you want to prioritize them and decide in which order you should do it. In my opinion, that's probably far too late to be, to be prioritizing. You should start much sooner, sooner than that. Um, typically you should be prioritizing at the, um, area, audience and lever level. In other words, you should, um, prioritize the areas on your website.</p><p>So, you know, that's. Testing on the product page is going to be higher priority than testing on the homepage. For example, you should prioritize based on the audiences too. So we should be testing on prioritizing mobile visitors over desktop, for example, and then you can prioritize on the lever lever being the kind of key.</p><p>Hypothesis behind the experiment. So, um, it might be a trust or delivery or, um, probably for example, these kind of core principles, because then you can cluster your experiments around those. You can get an understanding of which work in which stones. So that way you can say, okay, we know that the highest priority is to test on the product page and on mobile traffic.</p><p>And. The delivery lever has the highest wind rain so far. So therefore we need to come up with the best next experiment to run on that. Um, On that page, on that audience or that lever. And that way you've already done a lot of the prioritization work before you even start on the ideation process. Yeah.</p><p>And all you have to do is come up with the best next experiment. You don't have to come up with a list of 20 different concepts and then try to prove it. Those based on what I think my ad is going to have a higher impact than yours and vice versa. Um, so it becomes much more objective as a result of it.</p><p>If you do that. </p><p>Guido: [00:11:51] And so, so when you're running these more disruptive tech departments, uh, I can imagine you get a lot of backlash from the company is saying, okay. But if, if we do this, we need to overhaul our whole departments or, uh, the way we do marketing or, or the way we do business in general. Uh, how do you respond to that?</p><p>How do you help them understand that, Hey, this is actually important for you to do because otherwise in a year you might not have any customers or </p><p>Stephen: [00:12:19] always look to this. It's that same phrase that I mentioned a second ago, the best next experiment. So what we're trying to create is not the perfect solution for any given problem.</p><p>We're trying to create the best next experiment. What I mean by that is we would say to a company. You have to do this, and this means overhauling your entire department or structure or your value proposition. We want to use experimentation to inform that. And so it's kinda like the, um, Yeah. And taking the next step </p><p>Guido: [00:12:53] on the journey.</p><p>Yeah, because I see a lot of people that are familiar with experiments that if they, if they see those experiments upfront and then they already assume, okay, but if this is proven somehow, then we need to implement it. Then we need to overhaul everything to accommodate whatever the results from the next experiment.</p><p>Stephen: [00:13:10] But then that that's not necessarily a bad thing. Like if you run the experiment and it shows you should be doing X. And this is how much better it will be for your customers and for your business. Then you have your ready-made business case there, </p><p>Guido: [00:13:23] or at least it's food for thought. And then </p><p>Stephen: [00:13:26] exactly </p><p>Guido: [00:13:26] four more experiments saying, Hey, apparently we can do much better.</p><p>Precisely let's explore this more. </p><p>Stephen: [00:13:31] And if you decide not to do it, then, you know, the, the potential impact of that absolutely one thing that we will always do is in terms of kind of taking those baby steps. That's what we'll look to start with something. I guess there are two ways of doing it. You can either start with a big goal and scale it down to a very simple concept that you can test next, or you can start with something fairly simple, and then you test that and if it works, you test something else.</p><p>And again, and again, and again, until you scale it over time in terms of the potential impact that it has. Um, except for one, one of our clients, they were a, um, a medical client and we knew that every time we tested. Um, delivery as a lead, but it was successful. So if we added, um, uh, if we promoted free delivery in the navigation, for example, that was successful.</p><p>If we reminded people about that when they were on the product page and the checkout that was successful as well. And if we spoke about the speed of delivery that was successful, and we knew that essentially every test that we did around delivery, um, seemed to be successful. And it got to the point where we said to the client.</p><p>Delivery is obviously something that your customers really care about. How can we actually improve the commercial proposition? Because that could be a key advantage. It's something that, you know, your customers care a lot about. And so that's what prompted them to test same day in store delivery, because they have hundreds of stores across the UK.</p><p>And so we were able to test that in a fairly simple way before they rolled it out. Um, nationwide, we were just able to do that as a fairly simple proof of concept. And we could see that, yes, sure. Enough, same day delivery was, was very popular for, uh, for them. It was something that the customers appreciated.</p><p>And so we were able to use experimentation to inform something that would become a commercial proposition. And it wasn't like on a day one, we said to them, You need to test same day in store delivery because they wouldn't have bought it, but because we had, so I think it was about six months worth of AB test data to inform it.</p><p>It gave them the confidence to test it that, </p><p>Guido: [00:15:39] yeah. And those might not work out financially in the short run either, either. I mean, setting up their delivery networks and that can be a lot of time and money that you need to invest in it. But once it's skills. It's nice to make money. </p><p>Stephen: [00:15:52] Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:15:53] So, um, how, how do you go about determining, uh, what's a, what's a low versus high risk experiments.</p><p>How do you, what's your process to get more of those high risk ones in, </p><p>Stephen: [00:16:08] there were a couple of different ways that we can do it in the, um, in the blog post, I spoke about it, a fairly kind of skip simple scoring matrix that you can use. It it's one that works for us. And it asks you questions like essentially, um, What type of experiments are you running?</p><p>Is it on, are you changing UI or text you changing functionality or posting things of those is likely to be, to have a different type of risk associated to it. Um, you can also look at, um, the potential impact of the experiment even after you've stopped it. So if, um, I suppose we were working with, um, How do they want the big, um, fast food restaurants in the UK?</p><p>And they wanted to test a completely new, um, vegan range of products, for example, and then wants to do that as a painted door experiment. So they didn't actually have the products. They just wanted to add it to their website and see what people try and buy this. That is obviously a super high risk experiment.</p><p>The likelihood is that he probably wouldn't want to run that in the first space because. Um, as soon as people started seeing that word would get out, people might talk about it on social media. They'd get annoyed if they couldn't buy it, um, it might get leaked to the press and so on. So that was an example of a test that has an impact even after the test is finished.</p><p>That's obviously a pretty extreme example to illustrate the point, but there are plenty of tests like that, that brief on it. Conversion where the client is taking a risk. Beyond the cost of actually building and running the experiments. It could have a, an impact beyond that. So we've got a kind of fairly detailed model that allows you to estimate whether something is low, medium, or high risk, but that kind of very simple rule of thumb is essentially to ask yourself the question.</p><p>If we couldn't AB test this change, would we still roll it out? Because most of the time, people are testing things that they think are good ideas. And that kind of sounds counter intuitive. Like why would you not test something that is a good idea? Or why would you test something that you think is a bad idea?</p><p>But what I mean more is that essentially we only test the things that we think are going to work. We should be testing the ideas where either it will crash and burn and it will tank the conversion rate. Or it will have the completely opposite effect. So for one of our clients, one of my favorite examples is when we changed, um, we worked with a client, a SAS client to change their pricing model from one where people paid based on, uh, the, the tiers were structured on functionality and we changed it to a pricing model based on usage.</p><p>And if we didn't have AB testing, would we still make that change? Well, It's hard to say. Probably not because what they'd had already was working, but we wanted to see if this was better, but it would be quite a big risk. It was quite a significant shift. Um, when we did test it, it actually ended up doubling.</p><p>Sales doubling revenue from new customers. So it was hugely successful, but we might not have tested for it. We might not have made that change if we couldn't have AB tested </p><p>Guido: [00:19:27] marketing budgets have suffered. And the sheriff for AB testing has been impacted too. If you want to keep testing to enterprise standards, but save 80% on your annual contract, you can consider comfort with their summer release.</p><p>You can take advantage of full stack and hybrid features, strong privacy compliance, no blink. And enterprise great security feel good about your smart business decision in Fest. What you saved back in your CRO program, check out www adult's overbook slash 2020. So for, for those higher risks. So I can imagine that's a, yeah.</p><p>If you do that publicly on the, on the public website where maybe millions of people already shop. Yeah, that can be high risk, maybe even when you, when you release it and small percentages. So do you move those high risk experiments away from AB testing to all our validation methods or maybe use those first?</p><p>Stephen: [00:20:25] I mean, did we try and find a way to AB test it and because, um, I mean, we, we like the, I mean, for something like pyramid that, um, Tom and the guys on my dialogue, um, introduced me to, and it. It, it shows essentially that, um, RCTs or AB tests are the strongest form of evidence that you can get, especially when you do that, that Metro analysis of, of that from, from multiple AB tests.</p><p>Um, so I always look to try and find a way to, to inform it, but it might be that we essentially have to break it down into, um, a simpler concept. That's easy to AB test. So like the, um, like the medical climate with the. Same day delivery. For example, that might be something that would be too hard for them to do on day one, but we can take steps.</p><p>Towards it. And the same as with the, um, if we were working with, at a fast food restaurant and they wanted to see what would happen if we introduced this vegan range, we might say, well, rather than testing it on an entire range, let's try. And, um, it, it might make sense to test it on an individual product or even just to see essentially whether we could better sign posts, um, uh, existing products that are vegan, for example, and see what effect does that have on, on customer behavior?</p><p>It's. It's hard because there's only so much that you can do towards it compared to the benefit of. Yeah, kind of PR campaign that might go around or that should be launching a whole new product range and so on. So it becomes harder to test. So that sort of scale. Yeah. That's the, </p><p>Guido: [00:21:52] so we just defined a low risk, medium risk and high risk profile for four experiments.</p><p>What do you think is a good balance? Is, is there one way of doing this or does it depend on situation or company or, </p><p>Stephen: [00:22:05] yeah, I think, I think it, I think it depends both on the company and on. The the situation as well. I think, I think a company should not have the same risk profile all year round. For example, in other words, if you are a, um, a retailer and you make 50% of your revenue in November, December, and January, for example, then you might think, well, we need to have a different risk profile for that period.</p><p>Then the rest of the year, it might be that when, when you're in peak sales, you want to run. No high risk experiments at all, because he can't afford to crash the conversion and used to be focusing primarily on low risk experiments. So these are ones that iterate on. Previous winning concepts, for example.</p><p>Um, so those are the ones that you focus on doing that, um, during peak periods. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:22:57] That's all, it was a fun discussion of course, because like you said that you are making 50% of your revenue and it might be that that's a really important segment of your users that are mine, that might not show up the rest of the year, but are shopping on that, that part of the year, you do want to optimize.</p><p>If you want to optimize for something you should be optimizing for that, for the high peak part of a, of </p><p>Stephen: [00:23:19] the yarn. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, we, we would probably suggest in that instance to skew more towards low and medium risk and probably not to run the high-risk experiments. Yeah. It depends on each company's.</p><p>Appetite. I mean, we, we know firsthand the difference that, um, a higher conversion rate can, can make, if you have a high conversion rate and that allows you to afford a higher cost for acquisition when you could spend more than your competitors to acquire traffic. </p><p>Guido: [00:23:45] Yeah. Maybe also how fast Drori or audience and then your, your industry's moving right.</p><p>If every year is completely different. Yeah. You need to keep figuring out, okay. What's working this year. Well, if you're very traditional business, then. Might be totally different story. </p><p>Stephen: [00:24:00] Yeah, </p><p>Guido: [00:24:01] absolutely. So for those risk profiles, um, seasonality, uh, the size of your business, how fast your audience moves?</p><p>Am I forgetting something? </p><p>Stephen: [00:24:09] I would say also the experience that you have in your AB testing program. In other words, if you're just getting started, if you run only a handful of AB tests before, then you want to probably have a much more. Balanced profile across low, medium and high risk. If anything, you might want to skew slightly more towards high risk experiments, because low is when you're iterating.</p><p>That's typically when you're focusing on building on concepts that have already. Um, that I've wanted the past. Whereas if you're just getting started with AB testing, you don't want to narrow it down, focus too early. Only want to make sure that you are having a pretty broad approach to experimentation that you're testing a wide variety of, um, of leavers and you test them in a, in a, in a high impact way so that you can learn quickly whether or not they, they work for you.</p><p>Yeah. And I </p><p>Guido: [00:24:59] would also assume that there's a high correlation of the, the, the, the test effect size and the, and the risk profile. So higher risks might also be mean the higher reward usually. Uh, and, and if you're just starting out with CRO, um, Well, if you're just starting out, my assumption would be your probably in bit smaller company with less traffic.</p><p>You're not necessarily used to that. So if you have more risk, high risk, uh, experiments, there's a higher chance of you actually </p><p>Stephen: [00:25:27] finding something. </p><p>Guido: [00:25:30] And in your blog posts, you mentioned, uh, um, a couple of ideas to come up with those disruptive ideas. I think that's, that's a big challenge of course, uh, with many teams.</p><p>So how on earth do I find those disruptive? I do I, do I just sit down and brainstorm with my team or, </p><p>Stephen: [00:25:46] I mean, yes, absolutely. You can do. I mean, there are, there are a lot of techniques that can, that can work effectively. Um, in terms of brainstorming like one that we use, I didn't mention it in the blog post in terms of ways to come up with new ideas for more innovative ideas, this kind of higher risk concepts.</p><p>One of my favorites is the idea of invalidating law law, spelled L O R E. Law is the kind of anecdotal knowledge that exists. And your, in your company, things that you do, because that's the way it's always been done. </p><p>Guido: [00:26:17] And, </p><p>Stephen: [00:26:17] um, I got this, um, concept from an interview, uh, Jamal, who used to I'm Rhonda posting on Facebook and started, but he was talking about how.</p><p>Facebook's early success was based on this idea of invalidating </p><p>Guido: [00:26:34] naught. </p><p>Stephen: [00:26:35] In other words, find out what do you do in a company, because that's the way it's always been. But what do you do in your </p><p>Guido: [00:26:41] industry even because that's </p><p>Stephen: [00:26:42] where it's always been. And then challenge that and test that assumption to see is that still valid?</p><p>Should that still be the case? Because often people. By its nature. They accept that norm. That's the way it's always been. That goes unchallenged. And they don't necessarily realize that that could be holding you back. </p><p>Guido: [00:27:02] So how do you figure out what the law is? Do you go about interviewing people and then asking them what their assumptions are about their customers or how things work in their business or, </p><p>Stephen: [00:27:12] yeah, exactly.</p><p>I mean, we typically look to, to challenge. When we, when we first start working with a client, we understand if we want to go into the details of, um, the, of the product, how they sell it, how they make money from it, um, how it's structured. And then essentially we, we look to, um, I guess we want to kind of challenge it in an almost naive way.</p><p>Um, in other words, we might say. Well, why do you do it like this? And not like this and ask questions that are seemingly obvious, but in getting people to explain it one, it helps to improve our understanding. But secondly, also it highlights some of those opportunities for, um, To show where people are, are doing something because that's the way it's always been done.</p><p>So I'm </p><p>Guido: [00:28:03] trying to figure out Laura. So I think especially as a, as an outsider coming in, that helps. I think you, you notice things like, Hey, that's weird, poor white. Why on earth are they doing that? And I think, um, interviewing, um, um, just new hires. And asking them, Hey, what, w w what stood out when you started working for this company as an external agency?</p><p>Um, you're new, but you're still not necessarily working in the company. So you don't necessarily find out what the law is, but interviewing new new employees, uh, can really help because they're, they're doing this day in day out, but, but still are well, they're still new. So they're not, if you're working there four or five years, you have no idea what the law is </p><p>Stephen: [00:28:46] because it disappears.</p><p>Yeah, that's a really good idea. I'm like yesterday's brainstorm was so good. I really liked step's idea of running that test on the call to action buttons, making them orange will really make them stand out. Don't you think? </p><p>Guido: [00:29:00] Yeah. Right. Do you want to design real AB test winners and achieve enormous conversion uplift, then stop, brainstorming and take a sign difficult </p><p>Stephen: [00:29:09] brush.</p><p>Guido: [00:29:10] If you can read Dutch, follow the steps that online influence the best seller men, even book Delta now and ruling the office course and become an expert in applying proven behavioral signs yourself, go to &nbsp;dot com for more information and free down notes. The second one was a diversion thinking. </p><p>Stephen: [00:29:30] So divergent thinking, this is, um, a lot of people won't be familiar with this idea already, even if, even if they're not familiar with the, uh, with the name of it.</p><p>So divergent thinking is basically like, um, if you've ever been asked in an interview question, like name as many uses as you can for brick. Um, yeah, it's a perfect example of divergent thinking because normally they ask you that question and it kind of sounds kind of obvious, but then you have. Two minutes to make, to name as many ideas as you can.</p><p>And you start off by kind of saying, you know, we can build a house so he could build a wall, um, or he could use it as a paperweight on your desk, or you could prop the door open with it. And then after around 30 seconds, you've exhausted all of the. Obvious ideas that you can think of. And it, you know, I can start getting into a kind of weird and dark place in terms of, you know, what could you actually do with a brick?</p><p>Um, and then you were kind of a minute in and then it kind of gets worse from there. Yeah. That's an example of divergent thinking. This is the same kind of principle that's used in the crazy eights idea where you. Come up with one possible solution and then another, and then you keep on going. And when you get into ideas, six, seven, and eight, because you've exhausted the kind of more obvious ideas first that's when he started to get into that divergent thinking towards the end.</p><p>And that can be very, um, that can be very effective as a, as a technique that can work well, </p><p>Guido: [00:30:53] an exercise that you do, uh, with, with the decline team or, uh, the customers itself, the customers of your clients. </p><p>Stephen: [00:31:00] So normally we would do that. Internally within commercial.com and with our clients, I don't believe it's one that we've ever done with clients.</p><p>Customers. We typically look to the customer to show us the problem, but not necessarily the solution, although there's yep. </p><p>Guido: [00:31:21] So that's the divergent thinking. And, uh, the third one that you mentioned in your blog post, uh, for creating disruptive ideas is a two X instead of 2%. </p><p>Stephen: [00:31:30] Yes, this is, um, this is kind of what we were talking about a little bit earlier in the often when.</p><p>When you're looking to optimize a page and I'm sending guilty of this myself, my tendency is to look at the page. That's a thing. How could we make it ads a little bit better? And so from the very start you're thinking about, you know, how can we get this kind of marginal improvement in performance, as opposed to starting with a more.</p><p>Radical question, </p><p>Guido: [00:31:57] and then you'll get to experiments changing, changing button. </p><p>Stephen: [00:32:00] Exactly. Whereas in Sydney should be asking the question essentially, how could we make, how could we double the conversion rate if he could only run tests that would it be there? Double the conversion rates or more or nothing.</p><p>Then what would you, what would you test? What would you do differently in your testing program? I think it's quite an interesting, um, thought process to go through because it completely changes what you're doing. You're not going to kind of stick to the kind of standards, concepts, and ideas that you might have tested previously.</p><p>You're going to test something much more radical. Yep. The example that I used in the blog post respond from a company called I think Bosphorus, or Posterous, I'm not sure how you pronounce it. I don't think the company even exists anymore actually, which has maybe not the best endorsement as way of thinking, but essentially there, </p><p>Guido: [00:32:46] well, they would've, they would've gone away much better.</p><p>Exactly. </p><p>Stephen: [00:32:50] They haven't done this one weird trick, but what they did really well is, um, and do, do take a look at the screenshot in the, in the blog post, cause it's going to. Explain it way better than I advocate, essentially. They were like, I'm kind of similar to like a microblogging platform kind of cross with Dropbox.</p><p>I think that sort of thing, but basically the way that they, um, they improve their registration process, you know, normally my thing. Okay. How would you improve your registration process? You could reduce the number of fields you could. Tell people why you're asking for the information that you're asking for.</p><p>You could sell people again on what they're signing up for. So it's not just a functional form. You've also got that motivational content alongside it. You can do all these sorts of things, but what they did is they said, well, absolutely, you just let's skip the river destruction process altogether. They literally kind of say, step one, register, cross it out.</p><p>Um, because if you want to. Hosts, um, content on their platform. All you have to do is email the content to, um, give given email address and it automatically creates an account for you based on your email address. And that's it. Yup. That's a great example of that kind of two weeks thinking, you know, rather than how could we increase the performance of our registration form by 2% </p><p>Guido: [00:34:08] just to remove the registration.</p><p>Exactly. </p><p>Stephen: [00:34:11] And I love that kind of example. I mean, it's the kind of thing that, you know, you, it makes you. Cake yourself thinking like it's such a good idea. How could I miss that? But then if you do that enough times and slowly but surely you start to come up with those sorts of ideas yourself as well.</p><p>Guido: [00:34:26] Instead of just having a web shop, selling flowers just sends an email for who you want to send the flowers to for what location and we'll L M will. Yeah. </p><p>Stephen: [00:34:35] Yeah, </p><p>Guido: [00:34:37] exactly. Who needs a web shop? Thank you so much for going, um, um, sort of blockbuster with us. I think this is really interesting to get us out as our, out of our daily, uh, data grids and, and, and, and trying to think of more.</p><p>Uh, extreme examples that we can do to actually help our businesses way, way more than we, uh, than we currently do. Um, so you're obviously already a working on the evangelizing, this, um, uh, and, and trying to get more companies to do this. So in the next 12 months, what are you doing to help your companies to adopt this even more?</p><p>Stephen: [00:35:10] Support the clubs that we work with to understand the opportunities to run these high risk experiments. Ultimately it's not on us to, to push them or force their hand, but essentially to show them, this is how you, this is why you should consider it. And that these are the benefits that you could get me to persuade them.</p><p>Exactly. Because I mean, they are, they are the clients, it's, it's our job to advise them in the best way. Possible, but it's on them to decide what they actually want to do. Um, so that means that we have to work hard to essentially show the value in running those sorts of experiments, being prepared to test those, those kind of ideas.</p><p>Um, especially if you've been doing and, and just because you're running those kind of concepts that obviously doesn't mean that it's kind of word first time or second time, third time. Um, yeah. It's, it's on us to, to build the business case. For that too, to show them the potential upside and then show them how to do it, basically how to make it easy.</p><p>I think because often people think, like you said, at the, um, at the start, you know, people think that they might have to restructure the whole team. If they're going to test X it's on us to say, this is how we take this kind of big strategic goal that you have. This is an experiment that we think would inform it.</p><p>And this is how we can do it in a really simple and easy to test play. That's that's what we need to do to show them how to make this kind of experimentation accessible. </p><p>Guido: [00:36:37] You already have a database off of enough of those disruptive high risk ideas that you can say, okay, this, this is roughly, uh, the, the, the success rate that you can expect from high risk rates, high risk experiments versus low risk </p><p>Stephen: [00:36:50] or medium risk.</p><p>So we do, we do have a database of all the experiments that we've run. Um, categorize an air table. One thing that we haven't done is categorize them according to risk. Uh, the challenges that, um, talking about risk is only a relatively recent thing for, for us in this, in this kind of context. Yeah. And it's hard to attribute risk retrospectively.</p><p>I think. So it's more something that we're trying to build up over time. </p><p>Guido: [00:37:18] And w would you say that a high risk, um, experimented by definition also takes much more effort and time? </p><p>Stephen: [00:37:23] No, not necessarily. Not necessarily. I think at a high risk experiment could be, could be very simple if you want it to completely change your value proposition or your price or something like that.</p><p>It doesn't have to be a complex experiment to set up. I think that that's part of the problem is people think that the high risk stuff is no it's completely redesigned our shopping cart. For instance, it doesn't have to be, it doesn't have to be that high risk is, is. It doesn't need to be correlated to the complexity of the experiment.</p><p>Guido: [00:37:54] No, it should be easy to do. All right. Let's let's all start, start looking at our risk profiles and see if we can squeeze in a bit more of </p><p>Stephen: [00:38:02] those hydrogens. It's easy to do. Hard to sign off, I think is probably the balance. </p><p>Guido: [00:38:06] Do you have a final question? Uh, do you have any, uh, CRO related books or, or other resources that you'd like to, uh, dimension and tip to our audience?</p><p>Stephen: [00:38:16] A lot of the books that I've been reading recently are not CRO. Related </p><p>Guido: [00:38:21] or, or more general, um, books that inspire you or help you with your work </p><p>Stephen: [00:38:26] reading or rather listening to, um, when I go running at the moment is, um, uh, tools of Titans by Tim Ferriss. Um, which I think you're almost embarrassed to say the name it's it's um, I'm not sure.</p><p>I like the name of the book. It makes it a bit over the top, but it's really interesting and kind of talks about, and kind of typical Tim Ferris style talks about, um, Uh, I think health, wealth, and wisdom, some of the three kind of sections of the book. And it's essentially, um, summaries of the interviews that he's done, um, on those, um, Tim Ferriss show over the last five, six years, I just have a long is.</p><p>And it's really interesting in terms of kind of getting a kind of good insight into what other people are doing, what they're thinking, how they work, that sort of thing. And it's, um, it's so eclectic, you know, I can go for a run and then in a couple of hours we'll have heard from. Seven or eight different people and, um, and their beliefs.</p><p>And so I always come back from my runs with a kind of mental list of five or six things to follow up on and learn more about psych. </p><p>Guido: [00:39:31] Is this an actual, a book that he wrote or is it just a combination of all the </p><p>Stephen: [00:39:36] podcasts that you do? Yeah. This one is just the podcast summaries. So he talks about, you know, interviews with Schwartzenegger and, um, Peter Diamandis and.</p><p>Dot.dot, dot, dot. You know, you could be listening to someone who's a business expert. And then the another one from the Russian guy who popularized kettlebells and how he trains with them. And a lot of it is on the kind of attitudes you didn't have it. And so on. So it's, it's, it's. It's pretty interesting.</p><p>Guido: [00:40:03] Nice. Thank you so much. We'll I will share that one in the, in the show notes too. And of course, if you want to read more about this topic and probably you might want to have some visuals to support the story, go through the, go to Stevens, a block bars on conversion.com. Uh, you'll find a lot of, a lot of factoring additional information there.</p><p>There. </p><p>Stephen: [00:40:26] Absolutely. Thank you so much</p><p>‍</p>",,58e3303f

And markets is now committed to working on building startups. Ecosystems and developing the next generation of leaders for the innovation economy.</p><p>Sean and I discussed some strategies for navigating through tough times like these with COVID-19 and talk about how zeros like you and me can deal with companies asking us to optimize when there isn't even a product market fit. My name is &nbsp;and welcome to Shiro cafe, the podcast where I show you what the behind the scenes of optimization teams and talk with their specialists.</p><p>About data and human driven optimization, and implementing a culture of experimentation and validation. This episode, faith is made possible by our partners. SiteSpect content square, fertile comb, online dialogue. Welcome to Shiro cafe. And thanks for having us in your lovely garden. I noticed on your LinkedIn that you do a lot of stuff.</p><p>So how would you describe what you do? </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:01:19] So personally, my background is I'm a serial tech entrepreneur, a venture capitalist, educator. and now I spend most of my time working on, building content and curriculum for the growth X ecosystem of startups, accelerators, incubators. students and businesses that leverage the growth X Academy to re-skill and upskill their workforce to work in tech, and generally help build startup ecosystems around the globe, working with countries and companies on everything from commercializing new innovations to bringing the best of Silicon Valley to where they are to help develop economies and create jobs and, eliminate the brain drain.</p><p>Seeing their top talent, leave their markets and come to Silicon Valley when they can stay home close to their customers and their families. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:14] And so besides working in your lovely garden right now, how has COVID-19 impacted your business or your client's business? </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:02:23] it's interesting, I have four different constituencies and the first is the startup community, three different portfolios of over 43 companies.</p><p>And they're all very much focused on capital right now, either, raising it, making it or conserving it. So it's very stressful for the early stage companies that are very fragile. so we're working with them on tactics and strategies to conserve capital. increase their runway and figure out ways of generating revenue.</p><p>Now under these conditions, there's are our corporate clients that are all in triage mode. They're not thinking about innovation. They're thinking about survival for the moment. They're trying to just adjust to the work from home economy. they are, thinking and asking questions in the meantime about what the future might look like for the next six to 24 months and how this is overall going to impact and change their business.</p><p>Our government clients are still moving forward. I'm trying to figure out how best to support their systems. and then there's just the community at large, which is, folks like yourself that are reaching out for. thought leadership and content. And so I'm doing two to three interviews, podcasts, articles, webinars, almost daily.</p><p>When normally I would only do one or two a week. I've got a house full of college age kids that are all taking their classes online and feel like I'm running a dormitory. but, but everybody's being impacted, and there's prefers. There's there's the personal and the professional.</p><p>Really? How do you respond as a person to these kinds of situations? number one, and then number two, professionally, what do you do about that? personally, I think, the rules of life just remained the same, which is, it's not how you act. It's how you react when things are difficult that really define you.</p><p>and, I'm encouraging everyone to. go back and rethink reimagine, and possibly even reinvent everything about themselves and their lives and the things that they care about. Start with your core values and your physical needs, and work your way out to what's best for you, your family, your community.</p><p>there's never been a better opportunity. I don't think in my lifetime. And probably like you, I've been through many of these crises all the way back to 1987 economic collapse through the.bomb.com era through nine 11, which I think this is most similar to in that it's going to permanently change a lot of, things about how we interact and go through the world.</p><p>and of course the 2008. Economic crisis. And, so I think it's a great opportunity for everybody to take stock of their life. Think about that they care about, maybe get more focused back on the things I think that matter most, which are, your own personal individual health and wellbeing, and that of the people closest to you.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:11] Yeah. Is it also something that you see those startups do or do you see new startup initiatives focusing on that side? </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:05:19] startups are typically groups of very small teams, right? And because they're small teams, you're really dealing a lot more intimately with the individual psyches of the people than you are necessarily their product and their market in these instances.</p><p>So there's a lot of coaching, a lot of mentoring, a lot of support that's very similar to the personal aspects of it. but yes, once we get past and through that, then it's time to get creative, right? It's time to it's time to use this time to figure out how to stay on the field long enough to survive this.</p><p>Because I don't believe that it's the strongest that survive in these tiny kinds of situations where we're not talking about, moving humans through force. or violence or war in a traditional, since I think the ones that are most resourceful will survive, that doesn't necessarily mean have the most resources, but be the most resourceful.</p><p>Can you open your mind up to disruptive and new and interesting and different ways of thinking, of creating of actively listening to your market to find ways that you can solve. Immediate needs for them right now. And that's particularly challenging for four companies in the nice to have worlds or the nice to have markets, where something isn't a genuine need, but it's more of a want.</p><p>And, and whether they do, whether they pursue that industry, cause it's their passion or their belief or their expertise or whatever motivates them. The reality is that in economics? times like these, the nice to haves are usually the first thing to go. so how do you operate in that world?</p><p>how do you stay alive during these times? and so we're having </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:00] yes. And the students is that, the, bread making machines are hard, a high on the list for a must haves. And, things like bathing suits are high on the list of national Hess, right? </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:07:11] It's about physical needs, right? Everything begins and ends physical needs in these kinds of, in these times.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:17] Yeah. And, interestingly, so you say, it's about how you react, and our resourceful you are as a company. Are there any examples that you see around you, how companies, maybe surprise you how resourceful they are and what they do, during this time? </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:07:29] Yeah. I can talk about some, without naming names in my own portfolio, in my own world.</p><p>we've got some companies that are thriving as a result of what's going on because they provide. Technologies that are really around, distributed work environments, live streaming, for example, or they might be in the, in the modern e-commerce mail-order kind of subscription businesses.</p><p>and last mile delivery services. the ones that aren't in those worlds are really I'm teaching them how to reorient themselves around key problems that their customers have right now that they might be able to solve regardless of whether or not they have a product to solve it. So can they take on a service mindset and uncover true needs?</p><p>That they can solve for right now because they know it well, or they have the bodies to do work for somebody that doesn't necessarily otherwise have the budget to do anything that would be a fixed cost rather than a variable cost or how can they help their corporate clients through these triaged, moments that I'm talking about, where in the C suite, they're talking about two things.</p><p>All right. How do we keep our, how do we keep our employees? around and productive and paid, minimize the pain and mitigate the risk, while rethinking what life's going to look like when we come out of this and what can they do to contribute to that? it's really about having a sound market and business acumen around the area that you serve and then taking on that human to human approach.</p><p>Yeah. What can I do to help you right now? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:09:08] Online dialogue?</p><p>does that a specialist?</p><p>A team</p><p>and ultimately this year salmon Mecho &nbsp;social websites, sales funnels, and customer journeys for Mia info, China online dialogue. Have you already seen companies completely missing out on this or missing the boat on how to handle this? </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:09:44] I do. I see a lot of companies and in panic or immediately taking knee jerk, reactions of cutting everyone and everything.</p><p>I see them not providing, psychological, mental, emotional support to their people, the way that they should, it's times like the crisis is when you always see this, right? leaders, the right kinds of leaders emerged and the wrong kinds of leaders pardon the French here, but show their ass.</p><p>Yep. and when you see that you see a direct impact, I had a conversation yesterday with a very dear friend who was a very senior. C level executive in one of the largest tech companies in the world and certainly in the Valley. And we all know the name and I'm not going to name it because you could probably narrow it down to about five or six companies.</p><p>We'll leave it there. And he's struggling, with the fact that he is a, he's a manufacturer, hard charging, very direct blunt person. and he's always run production and buyers that are operated that way. And now he's got people freaking out and he, that the fact that they're freaking out frustrates him and his frustration is coming out because he's the kind of person, probably a lot like me, where when you're down, you just get more focused and intent and determined.</p><p>and a lot of people aren't like that. In fact, most aren't. So he's frustrated easily with those people. And he's expressed that frustration publicly and it's caused real problems. And now he's trying to figure out how to deal with it. And a lot of it is him learning how to grow in that area of his life and not react quickly.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:25] Leaders and managers are, I imagine, need a whole different skill set data these days. That they're not used to using or having </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:11:34] they do because everybody, for many of them, it's been good times for close to a decade. Yeah. economically speaking, even though depending on, worldview, but for the most part we've been moving in the right direction, economically commercially for, good seven, eight years.</p><p>Yeah. everybody has their challenges. We haven't nobody's facing anything like this in quite some time. and many of the people in the workforce, especially in the millennial generation, haven't experienced this in the workforce. They've experienced it in the household, growing up, seeing their parents struggle through the Oh eight thing.</p><p>and I think that's shaped a lot of who they are and how they think and their behaviors, why they're not buying houses or getting married or creating fixed liabilities or a credit card debt. they're saving money. I'm very impressed with a lot of those things. They experienced that, but yeah, they haven't themselves dealt with that, this kind of scenario.</p><p>Am I going to have a job tomorrow? and even if I don't, there's no other jobs and I can't leave my house, all of those things together. It's a real challenge. Yeah. So leaders, managers, anybody who's responsible for anyone else they need to step up right now. and they need to, reassure people.</p><p>They don't need to blow smoke, but they need to reassure people that we've been through these things before in our history. We, this too shall pass. We will get through this. And I know that days feel like months and years sometimes, but we'll come out the other side of this. And one of the reasons I'm encouraged by it is our economic crisis right now is self-imposed.</p><p>This isn't driven by a weak market. Yeah. There's strong demand out there. And I think that demand will come back. Certainly the longer we're in this situation, the more challenging that will be. but I do believe that there is pent up demand out there. It will come back. I just saw some data yesterday, that, cruise ship bookings in 2021 are on the rise.</p><p>In the last few days. Yeah. And so that, so who takes cruises? That's baby boomer generation people. And they're typically pretty conservative. And if they're starting to see that things will be quasi back to normal by then that's a good sign. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:13:56] Yeah. And the health are also things that are over. I can imagine that a lot of people are, we'll try to make up for things.</p><p>That's right. taking an extra cruise, extra holiday or, </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:14:03] yeah. And I think also I'm already seeing. People, on the corporate side, corporate officers and some major financial institutions are realizing like I have one really good friend. Who's a C office. I have two good friends at two of the largest banking, financial services firms in the world, two of the top five, and both are saying the same thing.</p><p>They're both been very pleasantly surprised with their ability to triage their way into a distributed work environment within weeks. Their activity is through the roof on top of it because everybody's. Moving money and dealing with the situation. and then on top of it, they're actually seeing productivity in the work from home environment, be much better than they expected.</p><p>And now they're having conversations about, do we really need all this office space in downtown? in downtown San Francisco, people are getting along fine. there's still people emotionally and mentally ready to crack. Don't get me wrong. and great leaders are aware of that. And they're in tune with that.</p><p>They have a high emotional intelligence and they're addressing it. And they're engaging people in ways that they hadn't before. I just had a conversation yesterday with a good friend of mine. Who's literally running his two day offsite that scheduled every year, he's running it virtually.</p><p>They're going to behave as if it's the thing and they're still going to do it because people need it. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:15:24] Yeah. And, yeah, you spoke about this on another podcast too. So if, if people are interested in that, the marketing transport guest, you spoke about strategies for navigating through tough times.</p><p>We will definitely link to that one in the show notes. just shifting topics a bit. what I often see is that when companies start with optimization, with this podcast is about, of course, a hero. I see that a lot of Ciro's people working in CRO usually. I think it's a much broader term should be much broader applied to this.</p><p>This is not just optimizing buttons on our websites. but it's often, the website definitely where it starts, where people start optimizing, of course, because you have the data over there. but when I see it, a lot of colleagues of mine, in this hero world, find themselves in a situation that they're asked to optimize a websites, while there.</p><p>Actually it's still now product market fit. And I know you've spoken about that before. So what would your advice be for sheroes that find themselves in such a situation? So I was trying to, or being asked to optimize something that doesn't actually have a broad market fit yet. </p><p>where to start.</p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:16:35] So there's two ways. There's two ways to answer this question. So if you're a CRO being brought in to an organization where the expectation is that you are to optimize what already exists, that assumes a lot, That assumes that there's standardization already. So I think about it in terms of these there's this kind of, four there's four phases to a funnel.</p><p>There's, there's ideation, there's creation, there's standardization, and then there's optimization. You gotta start with an idea. Then you've got to, then you've got to execute on that idea and then find something that's predictable. All our product market fit in order for standardization to even be a thing.</p><p>And then from there you can start to optimize. now that's a holistic overly simplifying it, but that's really how it looks. So if you're being brought into an organization to optimize, and you ha and you don't agree that there's standardization yet, then you better have that conversation before you're brought in.</p><p>Because otherwise you're going to end up with misaligned expectations and I've got this other formula and I like to call F equals Z minus our frustration equals expectations minus results. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:17:50] Yeah. </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:17:50] Yeah. If you don't, if someone's hiring you, paying you, investing in you to optimize and it's not ready for optimization, you need to tell them the truth because otherwise you're setting everybody up for failure.</p><p>And I see that all the time. I see an overwhelming majority of what's called a bad fit higher in these environments and early stage companies in particular, where they don't have product market fit being where someone's assumed that it already exists. And oftentimes the worst culprits are the founders, the hiring teams, not the person being hired.</p><p>Like I don't see CRS coming in and selling people on the idea of optimizing something that is that's not ready to be optimized. I see founding teams selling CRS on. Yeah, no, we've got all this shit figured out. You just need to come in and optimize every step and stage and exit criteria in the funnel and the customer journey and the full life cycle.</p><p>and then focus on iterating, based on that data. when the reality is that 80 to 90% of this time, this stuff is incomplete. There's a lot of, there's a lot of leaks. There's a lot of unknowns and things that we thought we knew that we didn't know. and any CRO who's been who's with any amount of life experience can identify with us.</p><p>It's not what you thought it was when you walked in the door. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:19:07] Never. </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:19:09] And then you've got to do the one step forward, two step back. Thing. So the question that I think the most important question is do you need to do your due diligence as a CRO first, put your investor hat on because I've been an operator and an investor.</p><p>And what I've learned about being an investor is that my operational experience makes me a better investor. And my investor experience makes me a better operator. What do I mean by that? View yourself as a CRO, as an, as a VC, somebody's asking you to invest your time and expertise and resources in a task or an activity inside of a company.</p><p>So you better make good, gosh, darn sure that you are a good fit for the thing, not just culturally with the people, but that it's at the right stage. And that what you're being told is in fact the truth. and I would, I encouraged CRS to require their own period of discovery before they make any sort of promises about what it is they're going to do, even if it's contract basis as opposed to a permanent basis.</p><p>but if you don't have an opportunity to dig in and understand what the current state of affairs looks like, then you could be putting. the entire opportunity at risk and it certainly may not be any fun. So that's the corporate, that's the one where, you're walking into a situation that isn't what you thought it was.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:20:39] Becca uninformed ends our beta test that happy Oak lost from the beginning of flickering, a very artist. He did come through. The key test was not to be included and I'm positive test tells that no Tyler's JIRA. Albeit convert comes our beta testing software. The smart insert that about any flickering of &nbsp;five gifts, Nella support fee, 24 seven chats.</p><p>The health would go by and, but dive is the last release was 15 Kia carbon positive. If you do this yourself, you have a knife and the fork and the</p><p>I do feel that, heroes are, very well skilled in, in, in, into ways of finding out that product market fit they're already skilled at using, while looking at a lot of data, using that to ultimize experiences. doing user research, that's kind of stuff. So how, even as a, maybe someone trained or skilled in CRO, how can we move forward?</p><p>How can I still help that company find that product market? </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:21:40] So they've got, everybody has to agree. Number one, the product market fit is a thing and that, and then it's defined by when the resources you have to fulfill demand are now, No longer adequate, that the entire sales process, from, from the top of the funnel through pricing discussions, through onboarding, implementation, and use, start to get a lot easier sales cycles shorten.</p><p>and if you're not seeing that. And you're not seeing a situation where if I just throw more resources at this will scale in some, by some measure. then, then you haven't gotten a product market fit yet. So number one, you got to understand what it means. Agree that it's a thing, define what it looks like for your organization together.</p><p>and then recognize that what you're looking for on the path to product market fit. the two most important things. Aren't revenue, they're time from your market and the truth in the form of that feedback as real time as you can possibly get it. and yes, some of that certainly touchless data-driven analysis.</p><p>That's, that's looking back. but a lot of it is in real human to human custom development. I can't tell you how many times I've seen conversion rate guys and girls, extend their path to product market fit by over using their tools and their technology. And under-utilizing the opportunity to have live insightful, realtime relationship oriented feedback sessions with individual users of every given profile and circumstance and channel and method and means.</p><p>and testing and experiment environment that they, that's offered to them. And I don't mean traditional focus groups or Google form surveys. genuine insightful discussions with user interviews that are developed by UX professionals that understand how to do user interviews.</p><p>if you have, if you don't know who Laura Klein is, you need to learn. if you haven't read the mom test, you should read it. You need to understand how to ask questions that get you the truth. And if you can do that, you can get there a hell of a lot faster and cheaper than just running people through your funnel.</p><p>so that's one area that I think is really important. I think the second is that I think CRS have to recognize their stage relevance, and the people that they work with also have to understand their stage relevance. Are you really good at going from zero to one? Or are you better at one to end?</p><p>are you somebody who co who's better at some certain amount of traffic or revenue, with a certain amount of team and resources already in place? Or can you create from day one, can you embrace ideation and creation to get the standardization, or are you more of a standardization and optimization person?</p><p>Because I think sometimes CRS put themselves in a bit of a, a corner. With the term with the turn optimization. Oh yeah, definitely. Yeah. and I think, you can be a CRP just as much as you can be a CRO, which is conversion rate professional, you'll leverage what, how to behave and what you know, how to do around conversion rates, to get a job done.</p><p>conversion rate standardization creation, and ideation are just as important as optimization. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:01] Yeah. And, sorry to grow. Thanks. you guys have a market acceleration program and that helps companies find that product market fit, right? </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:25:09] Yeah. it all started about six, seven years ago, myself and my partners were all serial entrepreneurs.</p><p>Turned investors started frustrated investors because our companies weren't succeeding. Not because they couldn't build products, but because they couldn't build their markets. and then right around the same time, roughly give or take five, five years or so you had this fundamental shift in the market where it became really, it became cheaper and easier to build and launch products than it ever had been before the call it the age of applied technology, where it's never been easier or cheaper to get products to market.</p><p>As a result of salsa, never been more difficult to get traction for them in the market. Yet, most founders were very much focused on their product. And so we just tried to solve our own problem first, which was how do we help our companies find product market fit? So we built a program and a specific methodology that became a private accelerator just for the companies in our portfolio that we call MXP or market acceleration program.</p><p>That's centered around a framework that's designed to do three things. Find the truth about where our product fits in the market, if it does at all, and what to do about it, create a functional learning organization out of the team of people responsible for that, recognizing that we have limited time, money, and resources to find our truth.</p><p>And then ultimately where's the business model. Can we find predictable, profitable, scalable revenue in some way, shape or form along the way? And if you can do those three things, you can find product market fit. And we do it across these three traction based model. and they're all, they're not based on revenue.</p><p>They're based on traction and have very specific goals, focus areas to execute against and then desired outcomes. But the number for one outcome we're always looking for is that truth. And then we're looking for pattern recognition around the truth. So it's an experimentation framework, but it's designed to be for learning because revenue comes from getting the time and the truth you need from your market, so that you can validate and iterate and pivot if necessary, 80% of funded companies fail in the tech game and 80% of the reasons they fail have to do with markets and people, not with their products.</p><p>And so a big part of what we do is try and level the playing field. So that the tech people who forever have ruled Silicon Valley Allie in the age of developed technology, which is what it used to be, which is when deep science would win, regardless of behaviors, because it was very unique and defensible that in the age of applied technology where it's easy to build stuff and copy things, you have to create market development expertise and focus on that just as much as you focus on product development.</p><p>And that means. Conversion rate optimization is a huge part </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:05] and you also have the growth X Academy and it's actually something people can just follow a line, right? People can just </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:28:12] originally we started with our w with a campus in San Francisco, inside of our offices and people could take fully 12 week fully immersive programs working on real projects with real companies in growth, marketing growth, hacking UX design, thinking, data science, entrepreneurial selling.</p><p>and our MSP market acceleration program. And then the demand came from, from a global audience that we want this and we want it online. So we started to move everything into a, into an online environment. And then we have licensing partners around the globe. Governments and accelerators and incubators and other universities that are, delivering the programming, in their markets.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:28:52] SiteSpect beat veiled and unique testing professionals, Nazi and product recommendation, all bullshit SiteSpect to server size. This is on the tax office Kips for doing optimal performance. . The SiteSpect approaching 80 minutes for tagging, I think cons of flicker effect Dave and days aren't back and forth with the</p><p>pain impact have open debate Testa and</p><p>and that's a, that's also program for people not necessarily working on zero sales, but also for sales and business, that fries. </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:29:31] That is correct. It's the whole idea is to cover. I want to build an army of market developers, right? I want to build an army of people who can help great product focused teams find product market fit.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>that's my purpose at this stage of my life. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:29:48] Yeah. So I can imagine a couple of zeroes thinking, Hey, I should, I know some colleagues I can send over. </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:29:53] Not only that, they can leverage them as interns. they, because, they work with, 70% of their education is experiential.</p><p>They get to work on real projects with real companies, the companies get free, help. They, the students get a portfolio of experience. and there's a big focus on their career and their mindset. And, the four pillars of the Academy are mindset, mastery, career, and community. We want to give people a growth mindset where they can be alerted all and not a know it all.</p><p>We want them to know that they can master anything with deliberate intent and practice. We want them to focus on a career. That's going to not just be, make them happy and satisfied, but be meaningful. And we want to create a community of mentors and companies and employers and alumni that will all be there to support them in those efforts.</p><p>And we think that's the future of education and the innovation economy. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:30:46] Do you see more people focusing on self-development in these times or, people too busy managing their households? </p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:30:54] Boy, I hope they're trying to take some time to develop themselves. it's always been in my natural nature. I'm a voracious consumer of information.</p><p>and I usually look outside of the disciplines and practices and I look more fundamentally into sort of base human behavioral stuff and try and figure out how to apply that in my craft. And I do I watch and read and listen and collaborate with all the thought leaders in sales and marketing and UX design and data science and startups and venture and education.</p><p>And I love and appreciate all of it. But I also look for, the thought leaders in genuine human behavior and trying to learn and understand who we are and how we behave and what we can do to be better, because I don't believe that there's a difference in the innovation economy between personal and professional development.</p><p>You develop yourself as a person, you're going to develop yourself as a professional. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:31:50] Exactly. It can be any, anything you work on, especially during these times. That's right. Sean. Thanks so much. It has been a pleasure talking as you. my final question. So you also do contributions to the post, so what's your next article gonna be?</p><p>Sean Sheppard: [00:32:04] So I'm working on it now I'm thinking about, what's the big idea. A is be the title and I'm actually going to be doing a five part webinar series on it as well for connection Silicon Valley. If people want to go, to connections, Silicon Valley, Google that, or go to the website, sign up for the webinar, but it's about how companies can either the next big idea, and then execute to find out whether or not if that idea is, Is the right idea to commercialize and monetize.</p><p>And it's a very practical, approach, towards execution because most innovations fail for the same reasons. Most startups fail. It's typically a lack of product market fit, and it's typically the behaviors of the team and lack of differentiation and timing in the market. And so right now, big companies are all thinking about how can I deliver a digital.</p><p>Experienced akin to my current analog experience in the age of COVID. so we're going to help them figure that out and that'll be my next piece. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:33:08] We'll, we'll be linking to that. If it's a, when it's published, we'll add that to the show notes. Also publication. Thanks so much. I would say have a lovely day, stay safe.</p><p>Good luck with, running. your student dorm at home, talk to you later. Bye bye, Sean, thank you so much for the interview. I really enjoyed your carton, our talk, and I wish you the best of luck with all that you do. And that concludes episode 16 off season two of this hero Fe with Sean Shepherd from growth X, and there's always the show notes.</p><p>It can be found on our website it's hero.gov.

So that was actually already my frustration during a university, because it was also very much directed at health behavior, which by itself is really good changing behavior in a health environment.</p><p>But I was more interested in the commercial purposes and the, yeah, I w I started working in a company who wasn't a dedicated to two D did. But eventually I was like, okay. I'm going to move towards that digital side, because that's where my interests </p><p>Guido: [00:02:04] are. Yeah. And now it's a brain engineers.</p><p>What kind of clients do you typically have or are there certain verticals that you guys are catering to? </p><p>Eltine: [00:02:13] It's very it's very broad our client base, which we're very proud of actually differs from retail to e-commerce financials. Government. Yeah. A lot of difference names also telecom.</p><p>Guido: [00:02:27] Yep. Okay. And what kind of research are you guys performing for those </p><p>Eltine: [00:02:31] lines? Yeah, what we what we do is we do neuro usability research. I guess most people are familiar with regular usability research and our method differs from that regular usability testing because we use EEG.</p><p>Which is mostly known as a medical device, but we use it in a commercial setting. So we have a headset that's actually useful in terms of their the medical ones you need to gel and everything on your scalp. It's not nice </p><p>Guido: [00:02:59] to have. I don't have to shave my hats if I'm a participant </p><p>Eltine: [00:03:03] in that.</p><p>And if you want to, but we actually, we identify Stu but yeah, we use EEG. And also where it differs is that during performing a task, so a participant, a user gets a task to perform. There is no interaction with the researcher, so no thinking out loud principles and no guidance. Walking through of a user flow or asking questions in between it's a completely in silence.</p><p>And the reason why we do it is because we measured a subconscious experience instead of the conscious experience. So we were really interested in what happens on a subconscious level and EEG helps to measure that subconscious level through emotions and Yeah, we've created our own emotion detection algorithm, which makes it possible for the EEG to measure the electrical activity within the brains, translated into three emotions in an online environment.</p><p>Guido: [00:03:55] Yeah, the very practical question. These gaps, you need to have participants on location. Otherwise you cannot put a cap on them. So how did you guys do this last half year with all </p><p>Eltine: [00:04:06] that's going on? Challenges? Of course we, I guess it was like six or seven weeks. We couldn't do any testing. &nbsp;In our lab we have a lab in our office.</p><p>During that time we had some how do you call it? The external users where we set up a tests situation. They were able to do research for us because they knew how to play CEG on their head and et cetera. So that was during six weeks. So it was remote testing in a new way.</p><p>But now after There, there have been changes. So we follow the guidelines from the the RFM or what's it called? And the MOA. And now what we do is we actually have all the hygiene. Situations going on within our lab as less as possible contact with our users. So they do come in our lab.</p><p>We keep distance. So the only time that we actually have contact with the participant is when we're standing behind him or her and placing the EEG on the head of the participant. So we're actually way less in contact with the user is as compared to a hairdresser. </p><p>Guido: [00:05:11] Yeah, exactly.</p><p>Good. A good way to fix it, and just to be able to continue to research. So for those not familiar with EEG research, so how does this relate? To online behavior, how can I, as a company improve my website using EEG </p><p>Eltine: [00:05:28] data. Yeah. So we look at emotional experiences and especially we're interested in the why of behavior.</p><p>Companies might have a lot of data regarding dropouts or regarding funnels and conversions, but they might not know why, what the reason is. People are. Going through the funnel or leaving that particular flow and we're are focused on getting to that answer. So the reason for the behaviors, so what is really happening here?</p><p>Why is it happening? And what we do through the use of EEG is we measure their emotional response which might differ from their rational response, because. We know from our psychology backgrounds and that a lot of behavior or all of the decision-making takes place on the subconscious level.</p><p>And we strongly believe that if you want to optimize your user flows, that you also should take into account subconscious behavior and not only focus on what users are telling you, because they might not know what they're doing or understand why they're doing specific things in a digital environment.</p><p>Guido: [00:06:31] Yeah I think our industry colleague botch crits always says that basically your conscious brain is just the passenger and trying to explain whatever decisions that your unconscious brain is making. So the unconscious is really important in, in making those decisions. But if I remember correctly from my my psychology backgrounds it's mainly the amygdala is that is emotional center of the brain.</p><p>But EEG and that's emotional center. They make lies in the center of the brain, but the EEG measures everything that's on the outside of the brain because it's not non-invasive. And so how does that translate to what's happening at the outer level of the, of </p><p>Eltine: [00:07:09] the brain. Yeah. So it's the activity.</p><p>So if the amygdala fires neurons, there are also other parts within the brain that become active. So in what EEG does measure the activity of which Parson brains are going on and off, so which become active and what we did by creating our own emotion detection algorithm. So we measured. The, so we brought users in a situation where they would be frustrated or that would be happy.</p><p>And then we would measure which parts of the brain would be activated. And therefore we made a relationship to which parts of the brain was responsible. And it's an, a dimensional skill from from zero to one with chances &nbsp;of the visibility of that specific emotion. </p><p>Guido: [00:07:52] Okay. So do you have to calibrate it for each person?</p><p>So if we first have to calibrate something for one person seeing, okay, how are, how do they respond to. Certain emotions and then look at a websites or is that very similar for every person? </p><p>Eltine: [00:08:07] So it's qualitative research. And yes, we do calibrate that. That's a very good question, actually, because we at our office, we will use to have, we used to have some limited parking.</p><p> When participants would come in they, there was a chance that would be frustrated due to having to search for a spot for 10 or 15 minutes. So obviously that is frustrating. What we do, we conduct the baseline measurements prior, before we start the actual test just to make sure that we know what they're what their baseline of emotions is so that we know them whenever they start interacting in that.</p><p>On that website or within a journey, we know that the response of the brain is related to the stimulus that they're they're re interacting with. </p><p>Guido: [00:08:48] Okay. That's fair. And you've, I think you've been using this tool for about two years now. Did you develop the brain peak tool? What have you learned </p><p>Eltine: [00:08:57] so much?</p><p>Guido: [00:09:00] In general </p><p>Eltine: [00:09:00] terms, yeah. We're going to start well, yeah. &nbsp;Conduct a lot of research in, on a weekly base. We perform four to five tests and each test is obviously unique by itself. Some are more in a broader sense focused on getting in size and otherwise others are really specific as well.</p><p>Even copy and understanding what the impact of specific sentences on a particular page are. &nbsp;But in general What I see at our clients is that they are amazed and very much interested in what's happening on that subconscious level, because obviously everyone has an opinion and everybody has ideas.</p><p>And in order to really validate what's what. What the worth of it is and what our it's a good idea. You should start testing, but just by asking people what you think of their, of an idea, you will not get that right answer probably, or let the complete answer. I think that's the most important take out at least for what I hear from our clients that they're like, okay, this is a dimension that &nbsp;we should really take into account when, because &nbsp;it's so much related to human behavior and understanding human behavior.</p><p> And if you understand human behavior, you're already more capable of optimizing. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:10:15] And are those companies usually using this as a way to validate like a new functionality or new designs or existing designs or yeah actually all of those. </p><p>Eltine: [00:10:28] Yeah. &nbsp;W we actually do a lot of prototype research as well.</p><p>So being in a development stage and just wanting to verify where they stand &nbsp;and whether it's a good idea. So prototype testing but also so also in live testing. So when it's already online we do benchmarks. So a lot of zero measurement, one measurements as well competition.</p><p>So if one of her clients wants to see how the competition is performing in relationship to how they are performing, then then we're also capable of doing it. It very much differs. And what we see is that quite some clients use it for CRO purposes obviously really get insight into how to optimize even further for conversion, but also are doing research related to service optimization, which is.</p><p>Different because if the goal isn't by itself or real conversion, but you also want to know what their experience is. &nbsp;And because it relates to loyalty and everything retention and stuff, but yeah. So yeah, we see a balance happening over there, which is for us really interesting because.</p><p>Especially now in times where everything's very much directed towards online you can really make a difference by creating or giving the user and experience instead of just giving, showing a flow, which might work. But hasn't really got that Oh, this is nice or, Oh, that's surprising. That's the, yeah, it gives a good experience.</p><p>Guido: [00:11:51] Yeah, exactly. And, but this research is usually I can imagine it's usually used as any or user research to point out where in this case, the biggest frustrations are, or at least the biggest emotion in general, are you still need to validate the solutions, right? You still have to figure out what the best way is.</p><p>I can imagine that if something is highly emotional, highly frustrating It can still be beneficial to you actually, when you point out something. &nbsp;Some basic principles in psychology when someone is frustrated and if you can make it hurts, people might be extra motivated to, to fix something.</p><p>So it can actually help to be emotionally more engaged or frustrated </p><p>Eltine: [00:12:30] drive. Yeah. Yeah, it is. But the frustration that we measure is mostly related to not being able to reach your goal. And therefore it's, </p><p>Guido: [00:12:40] that's usually a bad thing of course </p><p>Eltine: [00:12:42] websites, but so that's one of the three emotions that we measure, but the other one is attention of the other.</p><p>One's our attention and joy. And it's also an interesting one because. Attention by itself. Doesn't have to be a bad thing because a lot of attention means a lot of cognitive activity, a lot of cognitive load, but that can be interesting in a flow just to, to make sure that people really processed the information that is, that has given there.</p><p>Yeah, frustration. As being able to reach your goal isn't really positive. But then on the other hand, joy is related to being able to reach your goal. And therefore, very interesting too, to also have a look at, not only look at the things that are going wrong or might need optimization, but also what is in effect working.</p><p>And I think what what's, what is unique to our mythologies of we're able to really pinpoint. Even on the sentence level or element level what's going on the page. So instead of &nbsp;starting AB testing, because you might think it's over here or they might interact with this section and that might be an issue.</p><p>So we think we should optimize there. We can really pinpoint, on the, on a specific page, these elements are working just fine. They generate joy and these elements are frustrating. So if you start AB testing, you should start focusing on these elements in order to really specify where are the opportunities.</p><p>Guido: [00:14:06] And the pinpointing has on you, you combined EEG with like eye tracking </p><p>Eltine: [00:14:09] data. Exactly. Yeah. So I turned it out. We have a screen recording, so we also have mouse tracking, click tracking so we can really see where users are looking what they are doing when they experienced certain emotions.</p><p>And what we also do is during the research, there's no interaction with the participants, but afterwards we show the participants their own. Recording. So their own screen recording, and also already with the emotions with the emotion graph down below in which there are significant emotion points highlighted.</p><p>And what we do then is we asked the user, the participants to provide us with some feedback on those specific, significant emotion beaks in order to really have a a conscious. Part of feedback related to the subconscious experience. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:14:56] Yeah. W like I just said with the example, &nbsp;conscious mind explaining what the unconscious is doing.</p><p>So there might be a bias in there, but that's of course, a great insight that you can then again, use to to yeah. Create new versions of your websites and rerun those and see if those emotions stay or go away </p><p>Eltine: [00:15:14] or, yeah. Yeah, and definitely, and what's interesting is sometimes if we had we had one research, I believe it was two weeks ago in which eventually the feedback of the users was red or positive at the end of the flow.</p><p>But they directed it towards the brand itself. But if we look at that experience throughout the flow, there was at specific points, there was so much frustration going on and there were actually some use. There were really annoyed and a lot of attention asking parts of the site in in combination with frustration, which is a bad thing.</p><p>But in the end they rated it positive because they were very much directed and they were loving the bread. And that's, what's interesting by, so for that particular client, because they then were able to really see that, even though the Ray thing at the end of a flow might be red or positive a conscious level, but the experience by itself might not be </p><p>Guido: [00:16:08] That's a great way to, to measure brand effect that effectively the effect of the brands rights.</p><p>If you can just run the study with basically the same website or same stimuli or whatever it is, then just replace the brand with something famous versus. Something unknown. See what the effect of just the brand is. </p><p>Eltine: [00:16:26] Yeah. Yeah. Very interesting. And also for them in order, when they would now start, they're now starting to to do the optimization process and they're thinking of retesting eventually and to really see what the impact then is, because if they already have such a good brand loyalty and brand experience if they can also make that.</p><p>Their online experience similar to the brand experience that the whole experience of the of the product and the brand by itself goes up. Yeah. So </p><p>Guido: [00:16:56] very interesting. And yeah, you just already touched upon customer experience or you wanted to talk about humans using data. So &nbsp;why is this an important topic?</p><p>Eltine: [00:17:06] Think especially now, because we're all almost all of us are working from home. So we have little to no interaction with like physical interaction with our colleagues and also less interaction in general, because if you would be in an office you would interact instantly in there. Come something I'll be like, Oh, that's a good idea.</p><p>Or there's a little more creativity going on. So I think that is something that's missing right now. And I think it's also related to, if you are in the field of optimizing online experiences it. I look at CRO as something that should be a sort of culture. So I guess you've talked about it earlier on in your podcast as well.</p><p>Culture of experimentation. So we look at that as well. So it has to be. &nbsp;Carried out throughout the organization in order to be really successful. And now, because of all the limitations in our physical context, it's also relating towards the CRO process and their optimization. So if we only again start looking at Play numbers and okay, people are dropping out or people are not going to dispatch or they are on this page, but we do not know why that is happening and what their actual behavior is.</p><p>We are missing out so much. Relevance opportunities to to really optimize. And also because there's a lot of shifting going on towards online sales right now. Read some articles in in some news items last week with some indications of. We think that people are going to buy even more.</p><p>In 2021 online are really much focused on on buying stuff online instead of doing it offline and therefore it's even more important to take that human beings in account because. In the end, it's human to human interaction. So we are on one half of the funnel and they're on the other side of the funnel.</p><p> And sometimes I think we forget that we are still human beings in need of context, in need of some human experience. And yeah. That's why I think it's really important to really take that human part into data </p><p>Guido: [00:19:10] as well. Yeah. Yeah. I was talking to the organizers of the chiro ward. We also talked about the cultural of spreading that culture of of CRO and they were actually, they were saying, so especially this year normally with, when you, when in the Wars now you showed it at the offers I mean you go to the canteen and do a little speech or something that you've won the award.</p><p>But this year that's not. Something that happened. So it was a diminishing effect of they won the awards several companies, but it's the effect is a bit less within the company, the effects less in sharing that with the whole company. Because now you just, you send out an email, we want them to award.</p><p>Or maybe &nbsp;you shared at your, a small team meeting, but it's not a company wide thing anymore. Because everyone's sitting at home and I can imagine that's happening for a lot of things in those companies. Yeah. </p><p>Eltine: [00:20:02] Yeah. And I guess seeing is believing rights and, or at least experiencing is believing.</p><p>So visibility is everything. So are you have to show what the results are and show yeah. W what's really going on and I think that's even harder. Yeah. So yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:20:18] At companies that are using your research and trying to bring that inside the company how are they working on this?</p><p>How are they trying to embed this in their company culture? </p><p>Eltine: [00:20:29] So they tried to take it into their process of first year old. So I'm really focused on what their quarterly goals are or year long goals and make it into an end, like integrated into their program. &nbsp;For those that have already have a program.</p><p>Guido: [00:20:46] And adding, so adding neuro marketing to the whole research all the research options that they have, is it usually easy for them to explain that to their colleagues or do they really need to dive into it and really explain, okay, this is actually important that we should be doing this or.</p><p>Eltine: [00:21:00] Yeah. Yeah. It's not always easy. I've experienced. &nbsp;So what we hear is that so regular usability testing, which by itself, I think it's a good way of also getting insights. But it's a very well-known way of doing research and some might argue that even in the traditional way of doing research and I think that there are more.</p><p>There's a lot of innovation going on, on, on research. &nbsp;We see that the companies have sometimes a hard time explaining and really getting people Interested in why this is relevant as well, because yeah, that's another method of doing research and we already have so much data, so we don't need more data sets because we already have &nbsp;some challenges too, to make sure that we look at all the data that we already have.</p><p>Guido: [00:21:46] Yeah, but is it useful data though? You can have tons of data in Google analytics or big query, but yeah. Yeah. And </p><p>Eltine: [00:21:54] that's actually &nbsp;the conversation that we're having with the alongside, with our clients, if they need to explain it to other departments, we try to show them the worth of it.</p><p>So w and I think &nbsp;the most easiest way of explaining it is that we try to. Take w we take the subjectivity out of the, of qualitative research. So you have quantitative data, you have call it quality data. But with qualitative data, it's always a discussion of how you're interpreting it. And by using EEG and by measuring brain activity, you take a lot of subjectivity and interpretation out of qualitative research.</p><p>And I think that's the number one argument for them to use and to really show that there's there afterwards there w we also don't use like big reports that people have to. Read and read, and then it ends up in a draw. We use a emotion analytics dashboard, which also makes it more easy to interpret.</p><p>Guido: [00:22:50] Yeah. Yeah. For me it maybe that's my bias as a psychologist or user researcher, but I also find it way more challenging to find optimization areas. When looking at Google analytics than just doing user research, it's it feels so much easier. And especially the combination is very powerful.</p><p>If you just do a course overview of of Google analytics and see where people are getting stuck. No that down and then do user research to find out, okay, why are people getting stuck there instead of digging through a 20,000 Google analytics reports trying to figure that out it's for me, it's way, at least a way easier.</p><p>And because of it's way easier and faster. The cells are cheaper to do just random user </p><p>Eltine: [00:23:32] research. I think the magic is in the the combination of both, right? You need quantitative data in order to see what is happening, where, but you need qualitative data to understand why it is happening.</p><p>And for example, what we saw happening, there are a few cases. I believe in last quarter that there were specific pages of a flow of one of our clients who weren't performing the way they expected it to be so a lot of dropouts happening over there. But what we eventually saw that by doing neuro usability research, we saw that the issue by itself wasn't on that specific page, but it was already two pages earlier to that page.</p><p>So yeah. And if they would only focus on their Google analytics, it will say, okay, we need to optimize this page where people are they're leaving the patient. We need to automize it in order to make sure that that we enhance everything. But by really looking at why was it happening?</p><p>They, they could understand that the actual issue itself was already. Starting to work two pages earlier to that point. And by optimizing that they were eventually able to limit the Trump outs on the page to page later because they knew it already started irritating earlier on in the flow.</p><p>So it was a buildup. Yeah, </p><p>Guido: [00:24:48] exactly. And even broader than just the bachelor, usually when I'm walking for new clients, you can start the first year with fixing all the well-known low hanging fruits, but after a while, you usually start to figure out okay. But the problem is not necessarily on the website.</p><p>It's it might be the brand that you have. People just enter the website with a completely different. ID of what you are or the campaigns that you run set a completely different scenario up for you and different expectations of those customers. Then they land on the websites. Yeah. I cannot necessarily change the website in a way to completely change that, that brand image that they already have or customers, or maybe &nbsp;the delivery of the product is actually a problem.</p><p>And people do buy there once, but they never returned because you have a shitty. Maybe shitty products or shitty delivery or shitty customer service. Me tweaking things on the website is not going to fix that. And that's why it's important to, to combine all those different research methods. I think if you just get stuck in Google analytics, for example, like you just said, yeah, you can see the least optimal page there, but is that really </p><p>Eltine: [00:25:51] the problem?</p><p>Exactly. Yeah. So yeah, I think that the combination is a. It's so relevant in order to really look at a customer experience as a whole, because that's also, I think that has also changed in the last few years as when a few years ago it was more focused on like single pages or optimizing specific.</p><p>Elements or tools on within within a website. But now I think more and more companies are looking at from a more customer experience, point of view. So really swimming out and looking at the whole process and also taking offline into into account, which is relevant. Because, yeah. And that's an effectiveness of </p><p>Guido: [00:26:35] advertising.</p><p>Yeah. I think it depends a bit on how And how big the company is now present. They are, do they also do TV campaigns, for example, or radio campaigns, that kind of stuff.</p><p>Eltine: [00:26:48] It shows the relevance of the whole culture arise of when we need a culture of experimentation within companies to really make sure that if we want to optimize everything related to company goals, we should look at a customer experience. Point of view. </p><p>Guido: [00:27:03] But it's not something once you're a specialist has gone, they're just going to fix, so do you do companies usually, I only use the neuro-marketing as a starting point to see.</p><p>Okay. Where do we need to focus in the whole journey or do they already have a problem? Like they, they looked at Google analytics say, okay. &nbsp;Our checkout is a problem. Let's focus do newer neuro research on the checkout. </p><p>Eltine: [00:27:24] Yeah there for, so when we have a new clients most of the time we advise them to start with testing their most important sales journey, for example and do it on mobile device and a decimal device to really see what both experience are because they can deliver.</p><p>Enormously. &nbsp;That's most of the time of starting points, but yeah, w we also work for clients who do at least 10 or 15 tests with us a year. And they even test new propositions, so new idea, new product. &nbsp;It depends, but yeah we normally advise to do &nbsp;measurement at the beginning of the year and one at the end of the year, to make sure that you also take into account the most important user for your most important journey and to really see where you stand and how you're optimizing throughout the year, because.</p><p>We all know that we optimize little things and they can have big impact, but we w we also have to have some sort of zero measurement and a one measurements are really see okay. On overall. How did we perform in what are we thinking? Because that also helps in order to keep everyone aligned and really make sure that all the departments within a company see what the impact is of what they are doing.</p><p>Guido: [00:28:40] Yeah. And especially when you repeat user research, you get some kind of a benchmark or value or your own website with your own customers. It is performing. And then, yeah, it's also easier to test new stuff. That's not live yet. So you don't have &nbsp;the big data sets of bows, how users are behaving, but you can just test MVPs and benchmark that or shut it off against the benchmark that you already have.</p><p>Yeah. Yeah. So are you also working with the university of Amsterdam, all non emotional score emotion score? So how's that work? </p><p>Eltine: [00:29:11] We just started working with them a couple of weeks ago. And it's a specific girl case. &nbsp;Or core so to say of the ma master students it's called real-world case studies.</p><p> As we w we started out with with discussing how our psychology education was related to the real world and digital </p><p>Guido: [00:29:32] basically lacking all of that. Yeah. </p><p>Eltine: [00:29:34] Exactly. And at least the university of Amsterdam is doing a good job in my opinion, because they're now really looking at real-world problems at companies digital that are related to digital.</p><p> Yeah, but that started a few weeks ago. And we are, we were already working on an emotion score or so for example you have the system usability scale, which is used within our field and MPS. So net promoter score, obviously well-known but what we think looking from.</p><p>Psychological perspective, looking from the way we conduct research it, it doesn't really take into account the subconscious experience. So it's rating based on your conscious experience. And we already talked about is we know that it lacks the Infor the information that we would really want to know in order to.</p><p>Really optimize even further. And we're now working on an emotion score that takes into account the emotions that we measure in relationship to the experience of the total flow of a website. And when we can really make it a score S as compared to an MPS. So then you have MPSS and you would have an emotion score.</p><p>And I think that would be a. That would be great if we were able to do</p><p>Guido: [00:30:50] so how would you measure it? </p><p>Eltine: [00:30:52] Yeah, that's something there that we're actually now working on. So I cannot really answer that. We're looking at different things, but where we definitely want to take into account the emotions that we already measure.</p><p>So joy, frustration, and attention, and see how they relate to, for example the amount of Like eye tracking. So a pupil dilation, for example, but also the fluctuations within your eyes. If you're looking at the screen so scanning, scrolling behavior and really see if we can classify that based on literature.</p><p>So because they are very much focused on relating what they w the, this emotion score towards the science that is already there. </p><p>Guido: [00:31:32] Okay. &nbsp;But it wouldn't be as easy to measure with a simple survey. I can imagine. No, </p><p>Eltine: [00:31:38] that was new an MPS. And if you want, I would like now, because then again, we would be focusing on the conscious experience and yeah.</p><p>You want to also have a subconscious experience in it? So exactly. </p><p>Guido: [00:31:51] Yeah. Very cool development. I'll be looking forward to that. So do you think those are students working on the, on that this college here sorta probably be finished before summertime? </p><p>Eltine: [00:32:03] It has to be finished by the end of this year, at least &nbsp;the whole plan and the setup.</p><p>And then I guess early next year, we'll start implementing it. Or maybe even already in a sort of pilot phase. We are, we're thinking about implementing it later this year if it's there already. But we do not have the result yet. So it's renter. We're speculating on how to. Implement and when to start implementing, but these are at least the ambition, so yeah.</p><p>First quarter next year it would be wonderful if we would have the emotion score. </p><p>Guido: [00:32:35] Yeah, we're to go well, Tina, thank you so much for giving us a, an intro into into neuro marketing and what you guys are doing in this in this area. What can you tell us about the some developments in the coming 12 months or whatever?</p><p>What are the things you guys are working on or improving on? </p><p>Eltine: [00:32:49] Yeah. &nbsp;Are now working on a licensed model because quite some companies already owned their own UX research labs and have their own UX researchers working. And we want to focus more on the technology. So making it a puzzle for companies to start using our methodology themselves, because now what we do is we do the testing.</p><p>We have the hardware to software, in-house but we want to facilitate that companies can do this themselves and really implement all other types of presets that they already have. And yeah, make their own UX neuro lab. </p><p>Guido: [00:33:25] You were suggested by our previous guests Dave Powell from TomTom to talk with you who do you think we should invite for us Euro?</p><p>Both guests. Yeah. </p><p>Eltine: [00:33:34] I thought about it and I actually had a few names that came up into my mind, but I think was particularly interesting to talk to is Rick whole thing. He's responsible for ethics. And actually we work together. It's grow books. You you are familiar with them.</p><p>And we did a great we combined our research and our way of working. We did did an amazing stuff for them with. With amazing results. And I think Rick would be very happy to tell you about them itself insured. &nbsp;They developed a shoe finder already before last year.</p><p>And they started optimizing it beginning this year. And what obviously happened due to the whole COVID situation is that people were getting more and more interested in in. &nbsp;Running because that's one of the things that you can still do when the gyms are closed and everything.</p><p>So the relevance became a, in just a few months, extremely high. And we started working on a project with them and Crow books together. And we combined the, our psychology efforts because Chromebooks also works from that perspective. And yeah they made an amazing thing. So I think he will be happy to talk to you about it as well.</p><p>Okay. </p><p>Guido: [00:34:46] And my final question. So if there are listeners here that want to stay up to date and things, neuro Mark thing, or the descriptions that we spoke about, are there any books or blogs or other resources sources that you can recommend? </p><p>Eltine: [00:35:00] Yeah. &nbsp;Always personally I'm very much a fan of the system, one system, two thinking, I think that's basic literature that you should be </p><p>Guido: [00:35:12] The CRO Bible. </p><p>Eltine: [00:35:13] Yeah, it is. That's a good word, actually. It is. Yeah, it is. &nbsp;Yeah, that one specifically just </p><p>Guido: [00:35:20] reread it. Let's say that </p><p>Eltine: [00:35:23] reread it. I am also a fan of Natalie. Nah. Hey, I'm not sure </p><p>Guido: [00:35:28] how to pronounce her last name. </p><p>Eltine: [00:35:32] Ah, how great. Yeah, I think I sh I think she's great.</p><p>And I think she was one of the first also one of the first females who was actively out there promoting web psychology. &nbsp;I'm a big fan of her and her books. Are really interesting. Also very easy to read, even if you don't have a background in, in psychology or digital. It's.</p><p>It's really nice. Materials read. Yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:36:00] Yeah. I think already 10 years ago she she basically claims the title of the web psychologist. She wrote it, she wrote a couple of of books Let's see if I can find </p><p>Eltine: [00:36:11] what's it </p><p>Guido: [00:36:13] called, but that's a new one, right? Website branding for small businesses.</p><p>Eltine: [00:36:20] Yeah. Could be, yeah. </p><p>Guido: [00:36:23] Yeah. She has her ethnic of booklet, but hopefully she'll be able to join us for a podcast episode. So then I'll ask her, I, maybe there's a, I think he's probably writing a new book too. &nbsp;I'll ask her about that, but Eltine thank you so much for joining me for an episode. And we'll talk soon.</p><p>Thanks for having </p><p>Eltine: [00:36:42] me really. Bye-bye bye-bye.</p><p>‍</p>",false,

This session is with our notes, elements, freelance, SEO, and analytics, especially it's from online. Mark, I think, and a Charles meeting.</p><p>from a digital nation, in the UK. And the topic of this session was things that are always broken in analytics. And my first question was asking our notes about what the broken things are that he usually encounters when starting with a new class, </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:00:35] anything except for Google ads tracking. The rest of the shot, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:00:40] because that's what they </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:00:43] it's, that it's just, it's a tool.</p><p>In my opinion, it's a Google analytics is a way to sell ads. If it's the only one that gives you proper ROI reports and everything that one works, the rest you have to set up manually using UTM, tagging. yeah, pretty much. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:02] Is it usually that your clients come to you to fix those things or do they want something else happen?</p><p>And then, </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:01:08] you probably know the answer. They come to me because they want to grow. And then I look at the data and they say, 60% of your traffic is direct. We might first want to try and fix that. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:18] Yeah. Or you all can already fix those KPIs by just fixing. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:01:22] Exactly. And then the </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:23] already </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:01:24] reach, or I think by default there is.</p><p>There's hardly any, and even my own projects, I regularly find stuff that is broken and I still need to fix. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:36] So why is that is default so hard to set up and let us correctly? </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:01:42] I think there's a huge misunderstanding about things like direct traffic. Just ask anybody in your organization, what is direct and they go Hey, people type in the URL.</p><p>Really because it isn't and we know that. so I think, yeah, </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:01:59] so we're here to learn Arno to tell us </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:02:01] well, there's plenty of ways. So my biggest eye-opener was just last year where I really started understanding that's either the HTP refer that defines the channel, or it's a UTM tag. If neither of those is filled.</p><p>It basically ends up being direct. so with more apps, for instance, being there for publishers where you basically publish feeds of your content, if those are native apps and they're not UTM track, they become direct. So speed the other </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:32] category. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:02:33] Okay. Yeah, but they name it direct. So it's just.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:02:38] Yeah. Charles welcome. any, anything you want to add, whether it was usually most </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:02:42] brief things? I have a list of 145 common issues. These are things that keep on adding and adding. Now, couple of years ago, we had a client who 60% direct traffic, straight away you go that's wrong. We looked at the usual stuff and.</p><p>The bounce rate was all over the place and it wasn't a single page. And what it turned out to be was a programmatic bolt to randomly simulate user journeys. Now, the clients had not noticed this for six months. They reported these figures back to the bolt. So the biggest problem is the depths who setting up just assume they've been told, put Google analytics on and they think everything should work.</p><p>And then all the clever stuff. So the classic thing is let's not have a thank you page and a form. And then somebody says, I've spent a million on marketing, whereas on my thank you pages, I'm going to think about that. And it's a real, the biggest thing is broken is a lack of education and a lack of marketing people saying, put Google antics on and not saying what they want and lack of devs.</p><p>Who've told to do everything else. And somebody gives them a code and goes, there's a code it's done. We should </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:03:42] stop doing things with both bolts, even after, also after do concession, we shouldn't be using, messing up the bots. </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:03:50] You could do stuff with bots. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:03:52] Alright. I love bots. Crawlers are bots and like everything and you want to test journey, so it makes perfect sense, but there's plenty of things.</p><p>I think that the really interesting discussion, where people would, basically have CPA bidding on their Google ads based on a goal in analytics who somebody changed the goal. So instead of measuring, just say 10 conversions or 20, that were like 300 and they set the CPA to 50 euros without a budget cap.</p><p>So literally Google went all out because the signal was you're doing great. So they kept on spending more. So he ended up with spending about 10 K a day instead of just a few hundred. And </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:04:37] that's a classic example of a set and forget it, people set it up, somebody moves on next person takes over the analytics.</p><p>And we look at, sometimes we look at the goals and go, why have you got a goal for summer 15? Do you need it? They go, Oh, somebody else set it up and I don't want to touch it. we did one for an exhibition company and they have GA counts on every page. And I said, what are the I've already got access to?</p><p>He said, yeah, those other three, we don't know what they do. But if we turn them off, somebody from America is going to shelter us. Is it causing any damage? And we were like, no, cause it wasn't disrupting the data. But in that case, This is a big billion dollar company and the Americans were just not talking to the team because they didn't see the need.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:05:18] That's I give it a try and turn it off. See what happens. </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:05:21] They really didn't want to. There was a real fear of that organization. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:05:25] The other thing I think, as happened is when you start measuring the right goals, And their KPI is to reach certain goals and suddenly becomes less. They go nah, don't do that because, I might lose my bonus.</p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:05:38] Oh, we came across an organization that was bonused on the bounce rates. And we came in and said, but the bounce rate is fundamentally wrong. And they said, do you have to make, do you have to tell our boss about this yet? He's paying us. And the boss went. Okay, can we change it after Christmas? like I can't afford to lose my team.</p><p>It's a bad thing for bonus and we wouldn't yet. It's a really stupid thing. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:06:01] So is there any KPI in Google analytics that we can use for bonus? </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:06:07] Yeah, of course. And so the one thing that I started doing it was about nine years ago. I don't like the revenue field in Google analytics. So in eCommerce and I tend to, for any client use e-commerce.</p><p>Instead of goals. the reason being that any report you can just select e-commerce and it will tell you how much you make on the sessions from a certain device, from a certain location, whatever. but instead of sending revenue, I basically send profit and now a lot of objections are like you, but they don't really want to tell me the profit.</p><p>I've been there, that's confidential and blah, blah, blah. And then I go give me a ballpark figure. Is it 0.2 0.3. Is that 30? What's your average, profit per sale. And then just do it times zero three and send that. And then suddenly it becomes really clear where you're making the money. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:01] Yeah. Do we already have some questions from the audience, </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:07:05] Nick?</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:07:09] You had a question, right? no, not anymore. think about those questions, people. so when you spoke about, doing this for larger clients, does it help, if you're now working for smaller clients thinking, Oh, this all this crap, I don't want to deal with it. that's move up.</p><p>Market let's work for larger clients. They will have this all figured out. </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:07:26] No, they don't. They seriously, they don't. cause the same issues apply and it takes. That's not true. Some sort of sample the cookie this time we ever implemented enhanced eCommerce. It was four days. And that was for a big client because their devs were so switched on brief Winton.</p><p>I'm working for a very large UK retailer, and we are now a year into the project because the marketing team is on a completely different team to the team that runs the website and its politics and its silo. And how should we say, if we get it harvested commerce in, we can make the ad spend a lot more effective.</p><p>The eCommerce team is not well, just on that, they've waited there. There's no page, please. So they see this as a hassle and there's no amount of education you do. Smaller clients often see the benefits quicker because especially if it's a who owns it, and you're going to say I'm delivering more revenue to you.</p><p>That's it. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:18] Yeah, </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:08:19] smaller companies. I, so I love working for smaller companies. However, the problem is they don't have the money, time or resources to implement loads of the stuff. So it's always that sweet spot. So I'd love to work for scale-ups, but the larger the company, this is my personal view, the larger the company, and especially old school companies that started to do e-business basically.</p><p>It's fundamentally fucked. Yeah. It's really that bad. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:08:50] So how do you approach a, when a client comes to you and then, you need to do some, you need to do your work. how do you start out? How do you give them? Like an estimate? Okay. But we can start out, but we need X days, weeks, months to fix stuff.</p><p>And how do you sell that? </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:09:06] We just personally speaking, we demonstrate all the other clients we've done what it's for. Then we say out of 500, we found issues and that wakes people up. Yeah. And we'll say, I can't tell you is going to fix it until I know what the baseline is. The baseline we come in and we say, these are the issues.</p><p>This is the impact it's having. And this is the time it will take to fix it. So you can possibly going to get 10 of them halftime it's stuff that sums up the classics. The thing is small organizations don't block their own IP addresses. And somebody in that's been on the site or they've been testing, or we discovered the other week that people were filling out sales forms on the website.</p><p>So they were taking phone calls and then fleeing on the website. So of course their website activity looked fantastic. Yeah. And when we sh I think the best we saw was the company where we said, are you selling to the Philippines? And they were like, no, we don't sell to the Philippines. And 90% of all their traffic was from the Philippines.</p><p>Okay. All their staff are based in the Philippines and put st. GA tag on the external site. And the extra dates and the breaks. It was just a nightmare where I'm not really well, I'm gonna lose no to the traffic, but your conversion rate is really good because they would say our cost per act, our cost per acquisition has gone through the roof.</p><p>Yeah. Because you keep advertising to the wrong people. So yeah, a little bit, it's demonstrating to people and then once you've gone and demonstrated, you know what you're doing, and there was a route out of there, then you can say how long it's </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:10:27] going to be. Yep. I often do a little bit of a quiz. So I basically asked him like, what is direct traffic?</p><p>And literally I've only had one client that was properly being able to explain it to me. I asked the same for a bounce. Does everybody know what a bounce is here? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:10:47] Yes, we all know, but please explain. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:10:50] I think I thought I knew up until the moment I was at conversion hotel, number one, where, and she shut Muller basically opened my eyes.</p><p>What an actual bounces. So an actual bounces that only one interaction is measured in GA. So for instance, if you write a blog post, I often use this example. So you were at a blog post on how to fix your phone when it's got wet. So you write a blog post, put it in a ball of rice and just a complete how to some people just go to their computer.</p><p>They Google it, they go to that page. They scroll all the way down. And they won't be going to any other place on that blog because they've achieved their task. They wanted to know how to fix their wet foam. So they put it in a bowl of rice. They closed the browser. That page has 98% bounce rate.</p><p>But does that mean it's shitty page? </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:11:55] Depends on why are you checking how many people are I have fixed phones down, </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:11:59] but what I'm saying when you can't really track that? can you, so it's, but the way to do this is, in these kinds of cases, what I tend to do is I put, I send an event when people scroll to three quarters of the page.</p><p>Which equals to an intent that page was as interesting as I wanted it to be. </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:12:20] And we also do that. Then we put a timer tag on, so every 30 seconds. So we had a client that had, we took them for certain of charity and we took it from 3000 to 90,000 a year because the last website was so bad at a couple of good links from the BBC and the daily mail.</p><p>And they said, Oh, she's brilliant. But 90% of all our traffic leaves after a page and then their mindset, this is terrible. We went. Then we'll put a timer on there and then we put some scroll tracking, learn my whole, they will never three and a half minutes, but again, it's an education point of view. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:12:52] Yeah.</p><p>So I hear a lot about, misaligns goals and, bonuses. Is that something that improves in larger organizations or </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:13:00] yeah, but you have to go high up. And so it also depends on where you get hired. So if you get approached by a marketing team, they are probably in the silo of Mark. So they just want to prove, make the analytics work for their business case.</p><p>Whereas if you can get higher than say C level at a company or a founder or whatever, then you can define what are your actual business goals. what are you trying to do? And then start measuring that and then flow it down to those individual goals if needed. But otherwise it's really hard and trying to get in when bonuses get set, not when they're almost like getting on the payout side, because then you won't get any changes </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:13:45] wherever we go.</p><p>And we will say to people, if we're doing trading, whatever, we'll say, what information do you need to get yourself a pay rise? Don't tell me in terms of Google analytics or Adobe what's, you need to get your job done, and then they'll describe it to you because otherwise you're constraining them by going, Oh, I need this and I need that.</p><p>And then we say, if we do X amount of work, we can get you there. Or if we don't know, one of our clients is an old school catalog company and they've always lived off numbers. And there's a guy who said old school catalog was hard. Cause you had to send stuff in the post and it costs you money. You had to print and stuff.</p><p>And for the last two years, they have tracked every single click on their website, every single interaction. And they've just done a big machine learning project and they now know exactly what combination of clicks we'll get a sale and that is then fed back. But they couldn't have got there if they didn't have that culture, that maturity inside the organization that said it's w and they said, it's risky.</p><p>We don't know if it's just going to work and you want to be moving people all the time to that bill. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:14:45] Yeah. And so the other thing I'm seeing is that, numbers, so we all have had this question where people selling numbers, what is a good conversion rate? What is a good conversion rate, anyone, however,</p><p>yeah, exactly. or not depends. but, but what I've noticed is that when we talk in terms of profit and actual hard dollars euros or pounds, people really understand it. And I use a lot of analogies where I say, this is a store. This is somebody going into these kinds of things. You've got a hundred people walking in and 99 of them just walking up, but they actually had those products.</p><p>So what you need to visualize it to people have not. They're looking at numbers and I often tell people they're actually people, not numbers. Don't frustrate me. </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:15:39] we have that with a UK retail, it's got 200 stools. And I said to people act the same way in your stores. He went down with completely different because the store up in Newcastle is different from London.</p><p>I said, so why do people all act exactly the same way on the website? He went, Oh, I see what you're getting at now. Cause his mind there was just a website Vista. So for him it was just a waste of money. I don't care about the website. mate, you doing a hundred million a year and you really don't want to spend any money on optimization because inhibit it was still a waste of money.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:08] Anyone in the audience that just wants to rent all of their clients </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:16:14] or rent provide us. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:16:15] Yeah, go ahead. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:16:16] Yeah. I have a question regarding what the process kind. if you look at finance, if you look up operations, then they use a lot of data as well. And the first thing they do when they do an analysis is check for data, check the quality of data, and then we marketing people come in and then we just, we draw a conclusion first.</p><p>And when we don't agree with the conclusion, then we start checking the data, quality it more like a discussion on how we use data S in our marketing field. So we need to check first for the quality, instead of just running around with insights and analysis and making bonuses based on that, on the data analysis.</p><p>I completely agree. Couldn't agree more. </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:16:57] So what are the first things we'll always do is say, look at their analytics and say, how close are you? To your accounting system or your sales system. And if your mom to two to 3% out, you've got a problem. If it's within two, 3%, that happens because one of the first things we find is we go through all these actions.</p><p>People say, I don't trust the analytics system because that is what gets the wages paid. And some people say I'll report to them. I don't really believe in it. And that's normally when we've been brought in, because somebody got on this is ridiculous. We need to make business decisions based on allied data.</p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:17:30] Yeah. so I just got a proposal for one of my clients, an internal proposal to do and handsome attribution. and the girl who wrote it was actually really smart and really good, but my reply to her was let's first get rid of that 50% direct traffic that is currently in there because how. how in God's name are we going to do enhance the contribution?</p><p>If the data is not correct or not to be trusted because otherwise we'll just get into discussions afterwards, as you mentioned, where they go, yeah. But obviously Facebook is reporting that this happened and that you can't follow it. It's like now we're trusting Facebook. We'll trust what happened.</p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:18:17] We'll trust. Whoever makes us look good. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:18:20] Exactly true. That true. That </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:18:22] next </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:18:22] question. Oh, come on guys. I know you have a question. Cool. Alright guys, Marsha, how did you check the data quality of the implementation you were actually then, </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:18:33] applying </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:18:34] you see that the data quality at when you are there is rubbish, but then developer or </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:18:40] yourself needs to implement additional tax.</p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:18:43] How do you make sure that tax are. Good, sir. </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:18:48] Then you walk the customer journey. The very first thing I do is I fire up Chrome. Yeah. I like get GA tools or GAD bug. Am I go RO I take, I will take 20 minutes looking at GA game one of the most common pages, and then I will walk through and I want to make I'll attempt to make a purchase and I'll do it on mobility.</p><p>What are the most, what are the most popular devices? I'll do that first. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:19:10] so you are in most of the product, product teams. There are testers, but in this case for, from a </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:19:15] GA perspective, most of the time you test yourself. Yeah. We always test ourselves because we've often been brought in to audit that we've got an organization, so we're starting from scratch.</p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:19:23] So I tried to educate, my tester to also look at GA. she did it the first time, but the second time and third time, she was like, yeah, that UA code was filled. Yeah, but we were missing all these steps and she was like, Oh, but I can I test this? So one of the things that I'm looking into doing because of a measurement, a measure camp session was using ghost inspector, and then together with, GA debug to run it automated and then look at whether all the events fired.</p><p>So that could be a way to automate these kinds of tests spot. I haven't built it yet. But it's something that is in my mind of doing. and I think that the, secondly, it's, ah, there's another one I see so often is they use a different, GA code, on acceptance. or they use the same and they don't exclude the host name in the maintenance thing.</p><p>So what is suddenly it flatlines. So another good one is set up alerts for flat-lining in GA. Or huge struggle. </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:20:32] So things like payment gateways, somebody in finance has put a new payment gateway in and all of a sudden your top referring campaign is PayPal. All the new bark is all whichever territory you've got him because nobody in finance thought they'd get their job.</p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:20:46] Yeah. Yeah, exactly. so there's loads of these things that you really want to, but primarily tested yourself or. I get it to fail one or two times. And I'll double question it and then go to the founder and saying, we're missing this data and saying what happened because I want them to feel what it is to be missing these data.</p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:21:10] our wheels working assumption, assumptions, things are gonna break. So we have early warning systems set up, which basically might say, give us the top browsers, whatever it is. And then look back this week, last week at running average. And then you'll know if someone's broken something. So a couple of years ago, we did some work for HeartCore company on the brand new checkout.</p><p>And the conversion rate on day one was down 25%. Everybody went, this is supposed to be wrong. And these were days where Firefox was 25% of the market. And you couldn't check out and Firefox and turns out that only tested on one browser. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:21:43] Do you guys have any experience with outsourcing this and automating this?</p><p>there are, I think there are services out there. Let me, you can set up, </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:21:49] we spend a lot of time and look at how much we can automate this. But part of it is experience. So I use an auto, I use a lot of the tools around the Google antics, API to get me information quicker. But at the end of the day, I've still got to look at the data and go that the guys would have 60% direct at all is going to pick that up.</p><p>It's going to give me a hint. I could look at that one. so one of the things we did recently is we worked hard at the API. You could get the viewport and you can get the browser window. And so anything that's basically got a zero difference between the viewport and browser would, there must be a headless Chrome.</p><p>Therefore that's not human being. And that was 5% of Declan's traffic. And he went right. I even have a word with the it department, somebody that sets up their own server monitoring tool, all the best with the best interest, but they had to thought about that impact. So it's quite nice. There's an SEO tool called light bulb that natural light bulb.</p><p>Yep. Cyborg automatically. Doesn't follow the GA tag. Oh, that's it. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:22:45] But then I would say, so I work with the developers of a side bulb and say date. They did the same thing with Adobe analytics because it was literally killing it because it was trying to render every page. And it was so they're, you can exclude anything, but even with tools like screaming, frog, you can basically in Chrome, you can see, whether the GA tag is firing on every page.</p><p>So these are all. We're relatively basic, check. She want one, when I want to put in. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:13] Yup. And, you mentioned, Adobe analytics. most people, I think use Google analytics. Is there any inherent difference between those tools in how they handle this? Is there anyone and it's all better than the other or it's just all the same.</p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:23:28] No. I only got to work with Adobe, say in January, it took me a while to get used to it. it has some really cool features. but in general I still prefer J but that's probably it because 90% of the time I spend in GA </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:23:43] and it's still down for implementation. Yeah, you can't roll Adobe out of the box and it will just work.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:23:48] Yeah. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:49] Hello? Yes. I have a question. name and registration please. </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:23:53] Marino Tai. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:23:53] Hey, </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:23:54] what's the moment you can trust the data </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:23:56] and maybe okay. </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:23:59] Stop it. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:24:01] That's</p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:24:07] that's an excellent question </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:24:09] for the 30 seconds after you run every test possible and nobody else has messed with the code. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:24:14] Yeah. so to me, it's when it feels reasonable. I'm, &nbsp;no a lot of good feeling, but if I double check everything, so for instance, a great check for me always is you take direct traffic for instance, and you take the landing page.</p><p>If the landing page is not the homepage, it's probably a tagging problem somewhere. so these kinds of checks you can do, but if I fully customized everything and it feels like it's the right way, I check it now and then, but I, there is no health score as, Oh, I wish there was, but </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:24:51] there isn't when my analytics data sings correctly with other data sources in the company.</p><p>So what I'm seeing the same revenue and the same products that I'm seeing, the sales order system, because that's the stuff going out of </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:25:01] the warehouse. Yep. and the other thing like, it is not trustworthy. And, one of the people here build a tool, and I've spoken about it like two years ago here.</p><p>it's using the measurement protocol to spoof hits on websites and there is hardly any way. For them to prevent that from happening? there is, but it's quite complicated. So I think, do the best you can and then stay with that. </p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:28] You've been trying all your lives to get away from all those guts, feeding things and be data driven, but, </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:25:34] and Arnold basically says, just trust your gut mate.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:25:37] question one B or. </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:25:40] Oh, it's more, I think you all, both experienced and maybe an implementation from hard-coded to a tech manager </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:25:47] and this the </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:25:47] same implementation and different numbers. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:25:51] And it's old. </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:25:52] Coming back to </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:25:52] the feeling again? no. That is different because there is just depending on how much JavaScript is being loaded and when, that has, can have quite a significant impact.</p><p>Yeah. </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:26:05] It has an impact, but you have to live with it. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:26:09] So I prefer not to use tech manager for my analytics, but that's my personal opinion. Whereas </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:26:15] I see, I prefer I do. in the right hands. Yep. It's like the thing in the wrong, he has no access to what </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:26:26] I do affects us to quite a bit. Quite a lot. </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:26:30] Yeah.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:26:32] Yeah. One final question. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:26:33] What is the most interesting technique you have experienced in decreasing your direct traffic? </p><p>Charles Meaden: [00:26:41] Getting people to put UTM tags on everything that moves I've been asked. That's the obvious answer. I know, but yeah. </p><p>Arnout Hellemans: [00:26:47] Okay. so I have a deck of my SlideShare with, six practical flick fixes.</p><p>You can do a, it goes into search horse sources that are not being seen as organic and it does direct. So there's a few things. So the first one is adding a different, A loop, sources. So what is calm.android.google as refer. so you can basically filter on that. And the second one I've implemented is UTM tech, your open graph, for organic sharing.</p><p>So that is, it's a pity. Facebook itself, doesn't pick it up, but tools like Slack and WhatsApp do so you basically can see this is as people call it dark social. So Dan, you can make it as a channel as organic, organic social. So that's another trick, but just look up the deck it's on, on my SlideShare.</p><p>Guido X Jansen: [00:27:43] And for further deep dive, Arnold will be at the bar tonight. Thank you so much, China. Thank you so much, Charles. thank you for, for the questions. we will have a small 10 minute break. again, we will publish, probably publish, this session and the other sessions, if you want to. be notified that when we do go to Sierra adults, cafe slash subscribe or subscribe, if it's a podcast app, next session will be with two fairly familiar faces to you.</p><p>At least it should be Emily Robinson and Lucas Mira. We talk about data science. the one after that experimentation culture with Kevin Anderson from ING and Denise Fisher from Boulder gum. And the last one we're going to talk with Roger Dooley and bot skirts about psychology. So that's going to be interesting.</p><p>So see you in a bit. Thanks.</p><p>‍</p>",,0c43f3d1

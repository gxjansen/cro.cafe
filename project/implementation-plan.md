# CRO.CAFE Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for migrating four CRO.CAFE podcast websites into a single, unified platform using Astro 5.0. Each section includes validation checks to ensure proper implementation.

After completing a task, mark it as complete by replacing the [ ] with [x].

## 1. Project Setup & Template Analysis

- [x] Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore
- [x] Clean up template files and organize reference material
- [x] Set up project structure following Astro 5.0 best practices
- [x] Configure TypeScript with strict mode
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS with proper configuration
- [x] Configure ESLint and Prettier
- [x] Implement base metadata component
- [x] Configure OpenGraph tags and image generation
- [x] Set up structured data templates

**Validation Checks:**

- All template demo content moved to a reference folder
- No TypeScript errors (`npm run typecheck`)
- ESLint passes without errors (`npm run lint`)
- Development server runs without errors (`npm run dev`)
- Project builds successfully (`npm run build`)
- OpenGraph tags validate in social media debuggers
- Structured data validates in testing tools
